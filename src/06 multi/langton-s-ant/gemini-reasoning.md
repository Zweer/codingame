The puzzle "Langton's Ant" in the Wood League presents a two-phase game played on a `dimension` x `dimension` grid.

**Game Phases:**
1.  **Placement Phase:** Each player chooses `number_rounds` tiles to color with their own color.
2.  **Ant Movement Phase:** An ant moves for `path_length` steps, starting from the center of the grid. The ant's movement and color-changing behavior depend on the color of the tile it lands on and its own current color.

**Goal:** Maximize the number of tiles colored with "our color" after the ant finishes its path. The game has two rounds, and the total score is the sum of scores from both rounds. In this league, each player plays on their own independent grid.

**Ant Rules Breakdown:**
*   **Initial State:** Ant starts at (`dimension`/2, `dimension`/2), facing upwards, and possesses "Player 1's color" (which is "our color" in our context).
*   **On a Colored Tile:** The ant turns left, its color changes to the tile's color, the tile becomes white, and the ant moves forward.
*   **On a White Tile:** The ant turns right, the tile becomes the ant's current color, and the ant moves forward.
*   **Game End:** The ant stops if it moves off the grid or completes `path_length` steps.

**Input/Output:**
*   **Initial:** `dimension`, `number_rounds`, `path_length`.
*   **Per Turn:** `opponentRow`, `opponentCol`. This input is mostly for higher leagues where grids are shared. For this league:
    *   `-1 -1`: Signals the first turn of a round.
    *   `-2 -2`: Signals the beginning of the second round (requiring a reset of our internal grid state for placement).
*   **Output:** `row col` of the tile we choose to color.

**Strategy for the Wood League:**

Since we play on our own grid and the opponent's actions don't affect our grid directly, our strategy is purely about maximizing our score on our own board for each round independently. The total score across two rounds is simply the sum of individual round scores, so maximizing each round's score will maximize the total.

We will employ a **greedy approach** for placing our `number_rounds` tiles:

1.  **Simulation Function:** We need a function `simulate(currentGridConfiguration)` that takes a given set of initially colored tiles, simulates the ant's path according to the rules, and returns the final count of tiles colored with `OUR_COLOR`.
    *   The `simulationGrid` will represent the state of tiles (WHITE, OUR_COLOR, OPPONENT_COLOR).
    *   The ant will have a `currentAntColor` (OUR_COLOR or OPPONENT_COLOR). If the ant picks up `OPPONENT_COLOR` from a tile, it will then paint with that color until it picks up `OUR_COLOR` again.
    *   Directions can be managed using an array of `dx`, `dy` offsets and an enum for directions (UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT).
    *   Boundary checks are crucial: if the ant steps off the grid, the simulation ends.

2.  **Placement Loop:** For each of the `number_rounds` turns:
    *   Iterate through every possible empty tile `(r, c)` on the `dimension` x `dimension` grid.
    *   For each `(r, c)`:
        *   Temporarily add this `(r, c)` to our set of placed tiles.
        *   Call the `simulate` function to determine the score if we were to place a tile at this `(r, c)`.
        *   Revert the temporary addition (remove `(r, c)` from our set).
    *   Choose the `(r, c)` that resulted in the highest simulated score.
    *   Permanently add the chosen `(r, c)` to our set of placed tiles for the current round.
    *   Output the chosen `(r, c)`.

3.  **Two-Round Handling:**
    *   Maintain a `myPlacedTiles` 2D boolean array to keep track of tiles we've placed in the current round.
    *   When the input `opponentRow` is `-2`, it signifies the start of the second round. At this point, simply reset `myPlacedTiles` to an empty state, and our greedy placement strategy will automatically start building a new optimal configuration for the second round.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   `dimension = 15`, `number_rounds = 20`, `path_length = 150`.
*   Per turn, we iterate `dimension * dimension` (225) times to test each possible placement.
*   Each test involves a full simulation:
    *   Copying the grid: `O(dimension^2)` (225 operations).
    *   Ant movement loop: `path_length` (150 steps). Each step is constant time.
    *   Score calculation: `O(dimension^2)` (225 operations).
*   Total operations per turn: `dimension^2 * (dimension^2 + path_length + dimension^2)` = `225 * (225 + 150 + 225)` = `225 * 600` = `135,000` operations.
*   Total operations for `number_rounds` turns in one round: `20 * 135,000` = `2,700,000` operations.
*   This is well within the 300ms time limit for typical CodinGame environments.
