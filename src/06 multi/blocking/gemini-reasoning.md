The problem "Blocking" is a turn-based game played on an NxN grid, inspired by Blokus. The objective is to maximize your score by placing as many shapes as possible on the board. Each shape consists of several cells.

**Game Rules Key Points:**
*   **Board:** A 13x13 grid.
*   **Shapes:** Defined by letters 'A' through 'U'. Each shape has a specific pattern of cells.
*   **Placement Rules:**
    *   The first piece for each player must cover their designated corner (Player 0: (0,0), Player 1: (N-1, N-1), etc.).
    *   Subsequent pieces must touch at least one other piece of the *same color* only at the *corners*.
    *   Pieces of the *same color* can *never* touch along a side.
    *   Pieces of *different colors* can touch anywhere.
*   **Shape Usage:** Each unique shape (e.g., 'A') can be played only once per player.
*   **Orientation:** Shapes can be flipped (horizontally) and rotated (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees clockwise). This results in up to 8 possible orientations for each shape. An orientation is specified as `ShapeLetter[Flip][Rotation]`, e.g., `Q00`, `Q13`.
*   **Move Format:** `col row orientedShapeString`. The `orientedShapeString` includes the 1-indexed number of the square *within that oriented shape* that should be placed at `(col, row)`. For example, `0 0 Q001` means "place the first square of the Q00 oriented shape at board coordinates (0,0)".

**Puzzle Simplification from Input:**
Crucially, the CodinGame environment provides a list of *all valid possible moves* for the current player in each turn. This greatly simplifies the problem as we don't need to implement the complex game rules for collision detection, corner/side rules, or finding valid placements. We only need to *choose the best move* from the provided list.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize score by placing "a maximum of shapes". While the score might be more complex (e.g., cell count), a strong greedy heuristic for Blokus-like games is to prioritize placing larger pieces. Larger pieces cover more cells, generally contributing more points and potentially blocking opponents more effectively.

Therefore, the chosen strategy is:
1.  **Parse Shape Definitions:** At the beginning of the game, read all unique shape definitions. For each shape, generate all 8 possible orientations (by applying flips and rotations). For each orientation, store:
    *   Its unique identifier (`ShapeLetter[Flip][Rotation]`, e.g., `Q00`).
    *   Its `size` (number of cells).
    *   A mapping of its 1-indexed cell IDs to their relative `(dx, dy)` coordinates within the oriented shape's bounding box (normalized to `(0,0)`). This is important for understanding the `orientedShapeString` in the move input, even if not directly used by this simple strategy.
2.  **Turn-Based Decision:** In each game turn:
    *   Read the current board state (though not explicitly used by this strategy).
    *   Read opponent moves (not used by this strategy).
    *   Read the list of `possible moves` for the current player.
    *   For each possible move:
        *   Extract the `orientedShapeString` (e.g., `Q001`).
        *   From `orientedShapeString`, extract the `ShapeLetter` (e.g., `Q`) and the `orientedShapeKey` (e.g., `Q00`).
        *   Look up the corresponding pre-generated `OrientedShape` object.
        *   Retrieve its `size` (number of cells).
    *   Select the move string that corresponds to the `OrientedShape` with the largest `size`.
    *   Output the chosen move. If no moves are possible, output "PASS" (though this scenario is rare in CodinGame puzzles unless specified).

**Shape Transformation Details:**
*   A shape is represented as a set of relative `(dx, dy)` coordinates from its top-left bounding box.
*   **Horizontal Flip:** For a cell `(x, y)` in a shape with a maximum x-coordinate `maxX`, its flipped coordinate becomes `(maxX - x, y)`.
*   **90-degree Clockwise Rotation:** For a cell `(x, y)` in a shape with a maximum x-coordinate `maxX`, its rotated coordinate becomes `(y, maxX - x)`.
*   **Normalization:** After each flip or rotation, the transformed cells' coordinates are re-normalized so that the minimum `x` and `y` coordinates of the shape's bounding box are `(0,0)`. This ensures consistent relative positioning.

The `refCol` and `refRow` provided in the initial shape definitions (`Letter col row definition`) are ambiguous in the problem description, particularly with how `cellId` is used in the `orientedShapeString`. For this strategy, these `refCol`, `refRow` values are ignored, as the critical information (shape identity, orientation, and specific reference cell for placement) is fully encoded in the `orientedShapeString` provided in the valid moves list.
