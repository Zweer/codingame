The provided puzzle describes Nine Men's Morris, a strategic board game. The goal is to reduce the opponent's stones to two, or block all their possible moves. The game has three phases: placing stones, moving stones to adjacent fields, and flying stones (moving to any vacant field) once a player has three stones left. Forming a mill (three stones in a line) allows a player to capture an opponent's stone, prioritizing stones not in a mill.

The core challenge is to choose the best move from a list of valid commands provided by the game engine.

**Strategy for Wood League:**

For a simple AI in the Wood league, a greedy approach is often sufficient:

1.  **Prioritize Captures:** Always aim to form a mill and capture an opponent's stone. These commands are indicated by `&TAKE`.
2.  **Strategic Captures:** If multiple capture options are available:
    *   Prefer capturing an opponent's stone that is *not* currently part of one of their mills. This prevents the opponent from having "safe" stones.
    *   If all of the opponent's stones are in mills, then any capture is permissible according to the rules. In this case, simply pick the first available capture command.
3.  **Default Move:** If no mill can be formed this turn (i.e., no `&TAKE` commands are available), simply pick the first available valid command. The game engine guarantees that at least one valid command exists unless the game has already ended in a loss for your bot.

**Board Representation and Mill Detection:**

*   **Board State:** A `Map<string, number>` is used to store the state of each field (e.g., "A1": 0 for Player 0, "D4": 1 for Player 1, "G7": 2 for Empty).
*   **Adjacencies:** The initial input provides neighbors for each field. While not directly used by this simple AI to *generate* moves (as the engine provides them), it's parsed for completeness and for potential future more complex AIs.
*   **Mills:** The puzzle's board image implies 18 possible straight-line mills (9 horizontal and 9 vertical). These are hardcoded as an array of string arrays.
*   **Utility Functions:** Helper functions `parseBoard`, `getPlayerStones`, `isMill`, `getMillsForPlayer`, and `isFieldInAnyMill` are created to manage board state and detect mills efficiently.

**Game Loop Implementation:**

The game runs in a `while (true)` loop. In each turn:
1.  Read the opponent's last move (ignored by this AI).
2.  Read the current board state string and parse it.
3.  Read the number of valid commands and then read all valid commands into an array.
4.  Filter the commands to identify those that involve `&TAKE` (capture opportunities).
5.  If capture commands exist, evaluate them using the capture strategy described above to choose the best one.
6.  If no capture commands exist, pick the first general valid command.
7.  Print the chosen command to standard output.

This approach provides a robust baseline for the Wood league, focusing on immediate scoring opportunities (mills and captures) without complex look-ahead or threat evaluation.
