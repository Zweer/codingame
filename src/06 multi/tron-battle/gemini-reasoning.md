The core idea behind solving Tron Battle, especially in the early leagues, is to maximize the amount of free space your light cycle can access. The player who can claim and control more territory generally wins. A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an excellent algorithm for determining the size of a reachable area.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Represent the Game State:**
    *   Maintain a 2D grid (a `boolean[][]` array) to represent the game board (30x20 cells). `true` means a cell is occupied by a light ribbon or a boundary, `false` means it's free.
    *   Parse the input to get the positions of all players. For each active player, mark all cells along their light ribbon (from `(X0, Y0)` to `(X1, Y1)`) as occupied on your grid. If a player has lost, their coordinates will be `-1 -1 -1 -1`, and their ribbon should not be marked as occupied.

2.  **Evaluate Possible Moves:**
    *   From your current head position `(myX, myY)`, identify the four possible next moves: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
    *   For each potential move `(nextX, nextY)`:
        *   **Check Validity:** Ensure `(nextX, nextY)` is within the grid boundaries (`0 <= nextX < 30`, `0 <= nextY < 20`) and is not already occupied by any existing light ribbon (including your own current trail and opponent's trail).
        *   **Simulate and Calculate Reachable Area:** If the move is valid, simulate making that move. This means, conceptually, your cycle moves to `(nextX, nextY)`, and `(nextX, nextY)` now becomes occupied by your new ribbon segment. To determine how much *new* free space you would gain access to (or how much space remains available to you), perform a BFS starting from `(nextX, nextY)` on a *copy* of the current game grid where `(nextX, nextY)` is marked as occupied. The BFS will count all connected free cells reachable from this point.

3.  **Choose the Best Move:**
    *   Select the move that results in the largest reachable free area as determined by the BFS.
    *   If multiple moves result in the same maximum area, any of them is acceptable (the order of checking directions can act as a tie-breaker).

4.  **Output:** Print the chosen direction (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT`).

**Detailed Implementation Notes:**

*   **Grid Initialization:** A `boolean[][]` `occupiedGrid` is created for each turn. It's re-initialized and populated based on the current `(X0, Y0, X1, Y1)` values for all active players. This handles the rule where a defeated player's trail disappears.
*   **BFS Function (`getReachableAreaSize`):**
    *   Takes `startX`, `startY`, and the `initialOccupiedGrid` as input.
    *   Crucially, it creates a *deep copy* of the `initialOccupiedGrid` to perform its search, preventing side effects on the main game state.
    *   It immediately marks `(startX, startY)` as occupied on its *copy* of the grid and starts the BFS from there. The count of reachable cells includes `(startX, startY)` itself, representing the space you claim.
    *   It explores neighbors (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), adding valid, unvisited cells to a queue and marking them as visited.
*   **Performance:** Given the small grid size (30x20 = 600 cells) and maximum of 4 possible moves, each turn involves a few BFS traversals, each running in O(Width * Height). This is very efficient and easily meets the 100ms time limit.
