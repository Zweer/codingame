This solution for the Hypersonic puzzle focuses on a greedy strategy suitable for the Wood League: prioritize destroying boxes and moving towards un-destroyed boxes.

### Reasoning

1.  **Game Goal:** Destroy more boxes than the opponent. Players are immune to bombs in this league, simplifying decision-making by removing self-preservation concerns.

2.  **Map Representation:** The grid is represented as a `string[][]`, where `'.'` is floor and `'0'` is a box. Entities (players and bombs) are parsed into distinct objects.

3.  **Core Decision Logic:**
    *   **Can I place a bomb and will it destroy boxes?** This is the primary consideration. If the player has a bomb available (`bombsAvailable > 0`) and placing a bomb at their current location (`myPlayer.x, myPlayer.y`) would destroy at least one box, then placing a bomb is the best action.
    *   **If not, where should I move?** If a bomb cannot be placed effectively (either no bombs available or the current location yields no box destruction), the player needs to move. The goal is to move towards a new area with boxes that can be targeted in subsequent turns.

4.  **`calculateBombEffect` Function:**
    *   This function simulates the explosion of a bomb from a given coordinate `(bombX, bombY)` with a specified `bombRange`.
    *   It determines how many boxes would be destroyed and which cells would be affected.
    *   Crucially, it implements the explosion propagation rules: explosions extend horizontally and vertically, stopping if they hit a box (`'0'`) or an `existingBomb`. Both boxes and existing bombs block further propagation in that direction but are themselves affected (boxes destroyed, bombs detonated). Since players are immune, we only count the boxes destroyed for scoring purposes.

5.  **`findClosestTarget` Function (BFS):**
    *   This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the player's current position (`start`) to the closest cell containing a `targetCellType` (in this case, a `'0'` for a box).
    *   It ensures that the path only traverses *walkable* cells. A cell is walkable if it's a floor (`'.'`) and it is not currently occupied by an existing bomb. This prevents the player from moving into a cell that already has a bomb on it, which is an obstacle for movement.

6.  **Action Strategy:**
    *   **BOMB:** If `myPlayer.bombsAvailable > 0` and `currentSpotDamage > 0`:
        *   Output `BOMB myPlayer.x myPlayer.y`.
        *   For the subsequent movement after placing the bomb (required by `BOMB X Y` command), the player aims for the opposite corner of the map. This is a simple heuristic to encourage exploration and move away from the just-bombed area, preparing for the next bomb placement.
    *   **MOVE:** If the bomb condition isn't met:
        *   Find the `closestBox` using `findClosestTarget`.
        *   Output `MOVE closestBox.x closestBox.y`. CodinGame's engine will automatically compute the shortest path and move the player one step closer to that target.
        *   If no boxes are reachable (all destroyed or blocked), the player moves towards the center of the map as a default "idle" action.

This greedy approach aims to maximize immediate box destruction and ensures the player is always moving towards new targets, which is effective for winning by total boxes destroyed.
