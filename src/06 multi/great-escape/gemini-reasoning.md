## Reasoning

The problem asks us to calculate the sum of `N` integers provided in the input.

Here's a breakdown of the steps to solve this in TypeScript:

1.  **Read the first line:** This line contains the integer `N`, which specifies how many numbers are in the subsequent line. We'll use `readline()` to read the string and `parseInt()` to convert it to an integer. Although `N` is given, we don't strictly *need* it for the sum calculation if we simply process all numbers on the second line.

2.  **Read the second line:** This line contains `N` integers separated by spaces. We'll use `readline()` again to get this entire string.

3.  **Parse the integers:** The string of numbers needs to be converted into an array of actual numbers.
    *   First, `split(' ')` will separate the string into an array of string-based numbers (e.g., `["1", "2", "3"]`).
    *   Then, `map(parseInt)` will transform each string in that array into its integer equivalent (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).

4.  **Calculate the sum:** Once we have an array of numbers, we can sum them up. The `reduce()` method is ideal for this. It iterates through the array and applies a callback function to accumulate a single result. We'll use `(accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue` starting with an initial `accumulator` value of `0`.

5.  **Print the result:** Finally, `console.log()` is used to output the calculated sum.

**Constraints Check:**
*   `0 < N < 10000`: This means there will always be at least one number and at most 9999 numbers. This range is perfectly fine for standard array operations and `reduce()` in JavaScript/TypeScript. The sum will also fit within standard number types without overflow for typical integer values.
