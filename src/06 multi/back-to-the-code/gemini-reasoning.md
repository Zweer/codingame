The goal of this puzzle is to claim the largest number of cells on a 35x20 grid. You can claim cells by moving onto a neutral cell or by surrounding a collection of neutral cells with your own cells. Movement is one step per turn towards a target, prioritizing horizontal movement if the target is not in the same column. You also have a single "back in time" action, but for a basic strategy, we will ignore it.

My strategy will be to:
1.  **Understand Movement:** The game's movement rule (horizontal first, then vertical) means that the number of turns to reach a cell `(tx, ty)` from `(cx, cy)` is simply the Manhattan distance: `abs(tx - cx) + abs(ty - cy)`. My bot outputs the ultimate target, and the game engine handles the step-by-step movement.
2.  **Evaluate Targets:** Each turn, I will evaluate every neutral cell on the grid as a potential target.
3.  **Calculate Score for Each Target:** For each potential neutral target cell `(tx, ty)`:
    *   **Direct Claim Score:** Moving to a neutral cell directly claims it, so this adds a base score (e.g., 1 point).
    *   **Enclosure Bonus:** This is the most crucial part. I will simulate what the grid would look like if I successfully claimed `(tx, ty)`. Then, I will run a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from all cells on the grid boundary that are not owned by me. Any neutral cell that *cannot* be reached by this BFS is considered "enclosed" by my cells. Each such enclosed cell adds a significant bonus to the target's score (e.g., 100 points per enclosed cell). This encourages the bot to form enclosed regions.
    *   **Distance Penalty:** The further away a target is, the longer it takes to reach, so I subtract the Manhattan distance from the total score. This prioritizes closer targets among those with similar enclosure potential.
4.  **Select Best Target:** I will choose the neutral cell that yields the highest calculated score.
5.  **Maintain Target State:** The bot will keep pursuing its chosen target until it reaches it. Once the target is reached, or if the target is no longer neutral (e.g., an opponent claimed it), the bot will select a new best target in the next turn.
6.  **Fallback:** If no neutral cells are available or all are currently occupied by opponents, the bot will simply target `(0,0)` as a fallback (the game will likely end soon in such scenarios).

**Detailed Enclosure Detection (BFS):**
The `getEnclosedCellsCount` function works as follows:
1.  It creates a `visited` array to keep track of cells visited during the BFS.
2.  It initializes a queue with all cells on the grid's border (top, bottom, left, right edges) that are *not* owned by the current player (`ownerId`, which is '0' for my player). These are the "escape routes" to the outside.
3.  It performs a BFS: From each cell in the queue, it explores its 4 neighbors. If a neighbor is within bounds, not visited, and *not* owned by `ownerId`, it is added to the queue and marked visited. This simulates "flowing" from the outside through neutral and opponent cells.
4.  After the BFS completes, any neutral cell ('.') on the grid that was *not* visited by the BFS is considered enclosed by the `ownerId`'s cells. These cells cannot reach the outside. The count of such cells is returned.

This strategy balances immediate territory gain with long-term enclosure benefits.
