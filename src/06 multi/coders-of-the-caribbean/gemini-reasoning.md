This solution for the CodinGame "Coders of the Caribbean" puzzle, specifically for the Wood 3 league, focuses on the primary objective: collecting rum. In this league, the game rules are simplified: you control a single ship, collisions are ignored, and the `MOVE` command abstracts away the complexities of hexagonal grid movement.

### Reasoning

1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to prevent your ship from running out of rum. This implies a need to actively collect rum barrels.
2.  **Ship Management:** Since only one ship is controlled (`myShipCount` = 1), the logic for controlling multiple ships is not required.
3.  **Rum Collection Strategy:** The most straightforward strategy for collecting rum is to always move towards the closest available rum barrel. The game's `MOVE` command handles pathfinding and speed, so we only need to provide the target coordinates.
4.  **Distance Calculation:** Although the game is on a hexagonal grid, the problem statement for Wood 3 explicitly says: "Simply use the `MOVE` command to move around: that's as easy as moving on a normal grid." This suggests that standard Euclidean distance (or Manhattan distance) is sufficient for determining the "closest" barrel for the purpose of the `MOVE` command. Euclidean distance is chosen for its generally more intuitive representation of "as-the-crow-flies" distance.
5.  **Input Processing:** The solution parses all entities (`SHIP` and `BARREL`) in each turn. It identifies `myShip` and stores all `BARREL` entities.
6.  **Action Logic:**
    *   If `myShip` is found and there are `BARREL`s available:
        *   It iterates through all barrels to find the one with the minimum Euclidean distance from `myShip`.
        *   It then outputs a `MOVE x y` command, directing `myShip` to the coordinates of the closest barrel.
    *   If no barrels are found (e.g., all collected or gone), or if for some reason `myShip` isn't identified (unlikely in a standard game), it defaults to `WAIT`.

This simple strategy ensures the ship continuously seeks and collects rum, which is optimal for the constraints and rules of the Wood 3 league.
