To solve the Yinsh puzzle, we need to implement a bot that can parse the game state, understand legal moves, and choose the best action within the given time limits.

**1. Game Board Representation and Coordinate System**

The Yinsh board is a hexagonal grid with an irregular shape and a custom coordinate system (e.g., `a1`, `k11`). To simplify internal logic, we map these external coordinates to a standard 0-indexed 2D array `board[row][col]`.

*   **`toBoardCoords(cg_coord: string)`**: Converts a CodinGame coordinate (e.g., "a1") to an internal `{ col, row }` object. It handles the shifting column indices for rows 7-11.
*   **`toCGCoord(col_idx: number, row_idx: number)`**: Converts internal `{ col, row }` back to a CodinGame string.
*   **`isValidCoord(col: number, row: number)`**: Checks if a given `{ col, row }` pair corresponds to a valid cell on the hexagonal board, considering its varying row lengths.
*   **`CellState` Enum**: Represents the state of each cell (`.`, `R`, `S`, `r`, `s`).
*   **`Board` Class**: Stores the current game state, including the `grid` (2D array of `CellState`), lists of `myRings`, `enemyRings`, `myMarkers`, `enemyMarkers`, and counts of `myRemovedRings`, `enemyRemovedRings`. It also provides utility methods like `clone()`, `setCell()`, `getCell()`, and an iterator `getLineIterator()` to traverse cells in a straight line.

**2. Parsing Legal Actions**

The game provides a list of legal actions as strings (e.g., `c6`, `STEAL`, `b3-c3`, `h7-c7;xh5-h9xi9`). We need to parse these into a structured `Action` object that contains:

*   `originalString`: The raw action string.
*   `parts`: An array of `MovePart` or `RemovePart` objects.
    *   `MovePart`: Contains `from` and `to` coordinates. Used for ring placement (dummy `from` coord) and ring movement.
    *   `RemovePart`: Contains `markersStart`, `markersEnd` (for the 5-in-a-row), and `ringToRemove` coordinates.
*   `isPlacement`, `isSteal`: Flags to identify the action type.
*   `myRingsRemovedDelta`, `enemyRingsRemovedDelta`, `myMarkersDelta`, `enemyMarkersDelta`: Calculated changes in game state after simulating the action. These are useful for evaluation.

**3. Game Logic and Simulation**

*   **Phases**:
    *   **First Turn**: Output "yes" to request legal moves.
    *   **Placement Phase**: (first 10 turns, 5 rings per player) The bot places rings.
    *   **Movement Phase**: (after all rings are placed) The bot moves a ring and places a marker. Markers jumped over are flipped.
    *   **Removal Phase**: (if a 5-in-a-row is formed) The bot removes markers and one of its rings.
*   **`simulateAction(originalBoard: Board, action: Action, myId: number)`**: This crucial function takes an `originalBoard` and an `Action` and returns a `new Board` reflecting the state after the action. It implements the game rules:
    *   Placing a new ring.
    *   Moving a ring: placing a marker at the `from` position, moving the ring to `to`, and flipping any markers jumped over.
    *   Removing markers and rings as specified by the action string.
    *   It also calculates the `myRingsRemovedDelta`, `enemyRingsRemovedDelta`, `myMarkersDelta`, `enemyMarkersDelta` for the action.

**4. Evaluation Strategy**

Given the strict 100ms turn limit, a full minimax search or MCTS is not feasible. A heuristic-based approach is used:

*   **`evaluateAction(action: Action, currentBoard: Board)`**: This function assigns a score to each legal action. It simulates the action on a temporary board and evaluates the resulting state:
    1.  **Win Condition (Highest Priority)**: If the action leads to removing the 3rd ring, assign a massive positive score.
    2.  **Ring Removals**: Assign a high positive score for each of my rings removed, and a high negative score for each enemy ring removed.
    3.  **Marker Count**: Assign a positive score for increasing my marker count and a negative score for increasing the opponent's marker count. This accounts for newly placed markers, removed markers, and flipped markers.
    4.  **Flipping Markers**: Bonus for flipping opponent's markers to my color.
    5.  **Threat Detection (4-in-a-row)**: `countThreats(playerIsMe: boolean)` is a simple heuristic that counts sequences of 4 or more markers for a player. It adds a positive score for my threats and a negative score for opponent threats.
    6.  **Ring Placement (Placement Phase)**: During the initial placement phase, the bot prefers central locations on the board.
    7.  **STEAL Action**: If `myId` is 1 (Black) and it's their first move (`turn === 1`), the `STEAL` action is given a significant bonus, as it's often strategically advantageous to take White's initial good placement.

**5. Main Loop**

The `main()` function reads the game input turn by turn:
*   My player ID.
*   The current board state, populating the `Board` object.
*   The list of legal actions.
*   It then iterates through all legal actions, evaluates them using `evaluateAction`, and chooses the one with the highest score.
*   Finally, it prints the chosen action string.

**Strategic Considerations (Improvements):**

*   **Advanced Threat Detection**: The current `countThreats` is basic. A more sophisticated one would identify "open" 3-in-a-rows and 4-in-a-rows (meaning they can be extended without being blocked by an opponent's ring).
*   **Opponent Modeling**: The bot doesn't anticipate opponent moves. A simple 1-ply lookahead (what will the opponent do after my move?) could improve decision-making, but this might exceed the time limit.
*   **Ring Defense**: Actively protecting rings from being forced into 5-in-a-row formations by the opponent.
*   **Marker Pool**: Keep track of the total number of markers on the board and in the pool, as the game can end if all markers are used.
