The puzzle requires us to implement a Checkers AI in TypeScript. The core task is to choose the best move among a given list of legal moves, adhering to the game rules, especially the forced jump rule. The time limit per turn is 100ms.

### Reasoning and Approach

1.  **Understand the Game Rules & Input/Output:**
    *   **Board:** 8x8. Pieces are 'r', 'R' (Red King), 'b', 'B' (Black King). Empty squares are '.'.
    *   **Movement:** Diagonal, one square. Kings can move backward.
    *   **Jumps (Captures):** Must be taken if available. Multiple jumps must be completed. A jump means moving two diagonal squares over an opponent's piece, landing on an empty square.
    *   **Crowning:** A piece becomes a King when it reaches the opponent's back row. Red pieces crown on row 0, Black pieces crown on row 7.
    *   **Input:** Your color, the 8x8 board state, the number of legal moves, and then the legal moves themselves as strings (e.g., "A3B4" for a simple move, "A3C5" for a single jump, "A3C5A7" for a double jump).
    *   **Output:** A single string representing the chosen move.

2.  **Coordinate System Conversion:**
    The input uses algebraic notation (A1-H8). It's crucial to map these to 0-indexed `(row, col)` coordinates for array access.
    *   `col = charCode(column_letter) - charCode('A')` (e.g., 'A' -> 0, 'B' -> 1, ..., 'H' -> 7).
    *   `row = 8 - parseInt(row_number)` (e.g., '1' -> 7, '2' -> 6, ..., '8' -> 0).
    This mapping ensures that A1 is `(7,0)` (bottom-left) and H8 is `(0,7)` (top-right), which is standard for checkers and chess. The board input typically comes top-to-bottom (row 0 to row 7) from CodinGame.

3.  **Move Evaluation (AI Logic):**
    Given the 100ms time limit, a simple greedy heuristic will likely suffice. We assign a score to each legal move and pick the one with the highest score.
    The primary factors influencing the score are:
    *   **Captures:** Checkers rules dictate that jumps *must* be taken. Capturing an opponent's piece is almost always the best move. A multi-jump sequence captures multiple pieces, making it even better.
        *   We can infer the number of captured pieces directly from the move string's length: `num_jumps = (move_string.length / 2) - 1`. Each jump implies one capture.
    *   **Crowning:** Getting a piece crowned into a King significantly increases its mobility and threat. This should be highly prioritized, but generally less than capturing multiple pieces.
    *   **Simple Moves:** If no jumps are available, a simple one-square move is the only option. These moves receive a base score.

4.  **Scoring System:**
    I'll use the following point system to prioritize moves:
    *   `POINTS_PER_CAPTURE = 100`: High value to ensure any jump move is preferred over a non-jump move.
    *   `POINTS_FOR_CROWNING = 50`: A significant bonus for promoting a piece. This is less than a capture to prioritize capturing over simple crowning, but enough to make a crowning simple move better than a non-crowning simple move.
    *   `POINTS_FOR_NORMAL_MOVE = 1`: A base score for any non-jump move.

    **Example Scoring:**
    *   "A3B4" (normal move): Score = 1
    *   "A3C5" (1 jump): Score = 100
    *   "A3B4" (and B4 is a crowning square): Score = 1 + 50 = 51
    *   "A3C5A7" (2 jumps): Score = 2 * 100 = 200
    *   "A3C5" (and C5 is a crowning square): Score = 100 + 50 = 150

    This scoring ensures that:
    *   Any jump (100+) is better than any non-jump (1 or 51).
    *   More captures are better (200 > 100).
    *   Crowning is a significant bonus.

5.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   Read `myColor`, then the 8 lines of the board into a `string[][]`.
    *   Read `numLegalMoves`, then iterate `numLegalMoves` times to read each `legalMove` string.
    *   Loop through `legalMoves`:
        *   For each `move` string, parse its segments (e.g., "A3", "C5").
        *   Calculate `numJumps`.
        *   Add `numJumps * POINTS_PER_CAPTURE` to `currentScore`.
        *   If `numJumps` is 0, add `POINTS_FOR_NORMAL_MOVE`.
        *   Determine the piece at the `startCoord` of the move.
        *   Check if the piece, if moved to `endCoord`, would crown (i.e., land on the opponent's back row and not already be a king). If so, add `POINTS_FOR_CROWNING`.
        *   Keep track of `maxScore` and `bestMove`.
    *   Finally, print `bestMove`.

This simple evaluation function is fast enough for the given constraints and prioritizes the most critical moves in Checkers (captures and promotions).
