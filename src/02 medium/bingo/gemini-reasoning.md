The puzzle asks us to simulate a Bingo game for multiple cards and determine two key moments: when the first "line" is achieved by any card, and when the first "full house" (all numbers filled) is achieved by any card.

A Bingo card is a 5x5 grid. The center cell (index `[2][2]`) is a "free space", meaning it's pre-filled. In the input, this free space is denoted by the number `0`. A "line" can be any full row, column, or diagonal.

**Problem Breakdown and Approach:**

1.  **Representing a Bingo Card**:
    We need a way to store the card's numbers and track which numbers have been marked. Efficient lookup is crucial.
    *   `numbers: number[][]`: The 5x5 grid as it appears on the card.
    *   `isMarked: boolean[][]`: A parallel 5x5 grid to mark `true` for filled spots.
    *   `numToCoords: Map<number, {r: number, c: number}>`: A map to quickly find the `(row, column)` of a called number on the card. This avoids iterating through the entire `numbers` grid for each call. Numbers `1-90` will be stored here; `0` (the free space) does not need to be mapped as it's handled separately.
    *   **Tracking progress**: To efficiently check for lines and full houses, we'll maintain counts:
        *   `rowCount: number[]` (length 5): Counts marked numbers in each row.
        *   `colCount: number[]` (length 5): Counts marked numbers in each column.
        *   `diag1Count: number`: Count for the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
        *   `diag2Count: number`: Count for the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
        *   `totalMarked: number`: Total count of marked numbers for a full house check.
    *   `hasLine: boolean`, `hasFullHouse: boolean`: Flags to remember if a card has already achieved these states, preventing redundant checks or updates.

2.  **Card Initialization**:
    *   When a `BingoCard` object is created, its `numbers` and `numToCoords` should be populated from the input.
    *   The free space at `[2][2]` should be marked immediately. This involves setting `isMarked[2][2] = true` and incrementing the corresponding `totalMarked`, `rowCount[2]`, `colCount[2]`, `diag1Count`, and `diag2Count`.

3.  **Processing Called Numbers**:
    *   For each number called in sequence:
        *   Iterate through all active `BingoCard` objects.
        *   For each card, check if the `calledNumber` exists on it using `numToCoords`.
        *   If it exists and isn't already marked:
            *   Mark it (`isMarked[r][c] = true`).
            *   Update `totalMarked`, `rowCount`, `colCount`, `diag1Count`, `diag2Count` for that card.

4.  **Checking for Wins**:
    *   After processing a `calledNumber` for a card, check its state:
        *   **Line**: If `!card.hasLine`, check if any `rowCount[i]`, `colCount[i]`, `diag1Count`, or `diag2Count` has reached `5`. If so, update `card.hasLine = true`.
        *   **Full House**: If `!card.hasFullHouse`, check if `totalMarked` has reached `25`. If so, update `card.hasFullHouse = true`.

5.  **Global Minimum Calls**:
    *   Maintain `firstLineCalls` and `firstFullHouseCalls` variables, initialized to `Infinity`.
    *   Also, `lineAchievedGlobally` and `fullHouseAchievedGlobally` flags to prevent unnecessary updates once the minimum has been found across all cards.
    *   When a card achieves a line, update `firstLineCalls = Math.min(firstLineCalls, callCount)`. Set `lineAchievedGlobally = true` after iterating through all cards for the current `callCount` if `firstLineCalls` is no longer `Infinity`. Do similarly for full house.
    *   Once both `lineAchievedGlobally` and `fullHouseAchievedGlobally` are true, we can stop the simulation early.

**Example Walkthrough (Row Completion):**
Consider a row `[37, 29, 0, 54, 22]`. The `0` at `[2][2]` (the center) is immediately marked. `rowCount[2]` becomes 1.
If `29` is called (`callCount`=10): `rowCount[2]` becomes 2.
If `54` is called (`callCount`=11): `rowCount[2]` becomes 3.
If `22` is called (`callCount`=22): `rowCount[2]` becomes 4.
If `37` is called (`callCount`=54): `rowCount[2]` becomes 5. At this point, the `checkLine()` method detects `rowCount[2] === 5`, sets `card.hasLine = true`, and the main loop updates `firstLineCalls` to 54.

This robust approach handles multiple cards, multiple winning conditions, and identifies the earliest successful call counts.
