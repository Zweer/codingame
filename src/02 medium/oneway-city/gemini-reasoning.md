The problem asks us to find the number of unique routes from the North-West corner to the South-East corner of an `M x N` city grid, where movement is restricted to only South or East directions. The final answer should be truncated to its most significant 1000 digits.

### 1. Understanding the Grid and Path

The interpretation of `M x N` grid is crucial. The example `M=4, N=4` yielding `20` suggests that `M` represents the number of rows and `N` represents the number of columns.
To move from the North-West corner (top-left) to the South-East corner (bottom-right) in an `M` row by `N` column grid, you must make:
*   `M-1` moves to the South (to reach the last row from the first).
*   `N-1` moves to the East (to reach the last column from the first).

Let `R = M-1` be the number of South moves and `C = N-1` be the number of East moves.
The total number of moves will be `R + C`.
This problem is a classic combinatorial one: finding the number of ways to arrange `R` 'S' (South) moves and `C` 'E' (East) moves in a sequence of `R + C` total moves. This is given by the binomial coefficient `C(R+C, R)` (or `C(R+C, C)`), which is calculated as `(R+C)! / (R! * C!)`.

For the example `M=4, N=4`:
`R = 4-1 = 3`
`C = 4-1 = 3`
Total moves = `3 + 3 = 6`.
Number of routes = `C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1)) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20`. This matches the example output.

### 2. Handling Large Numbers

The constraints are `0 < M, N <= 5000`. This means `R` and `C` can be up to `4999`.
The total number of moves `R+C` can be up to `4999 + 4999 = 9998`.
Calculating factorials like `9998!` would result in an astronomically large number. The number of digits for `C(9998, 4999)` is approximately 3000. Standard integer types cannot hold this.

TypeScript's `BigInt` type can handle arbitrary-precision integers. A direct calculation like `(BigInt(R+C)!) / (BigInt(R)! * BigInt(C)!)` is still problematic because intermediate factorials become too large even for `BigInt` if computed directly. A common way to calculate `C(N, K)` with `BigInt` is iteratively:
`C(N, K) = 1`
`For i from 0 to K-1: C(N, K) = C(N, K) * (N - i) / (i + 1)`
While this avoids direct large factorials, the multiplications and divisions for numbers with thousands of digits can still be slow. `O(K * D^1.58)` where `D` is the number of digits could be too much for `K=4999` and `D=3000`.

A more efficient and robust approach for very large binomial coefficients is to use prime factorization.
`C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!) = Product(p^e_p)` for all prime numbers `p`.
The exponent `e_p` for each prime `p` is calculated as:
`e_p = (exponent of p in N!) - (exponent of p in K!) - (exponent of p in (N-K)!)`
The exponent of a prime `p` in `n!` is given by Legendre's Formula: `sum(floor(n / p^k))` for `k=1, 2, 3, ...` until `p^k > n`.

### 3. Algorithm Steps

1.  **Read Input**: Get `M` and `N`.
2.  **Calculate R and C**: `R = M - 1`, `C = N - 1`.
3.  **Handle Base Case**: If `R=0` and `C=0` (i.e., `M=1, N=1`), the answer is `1` (one way to stay at the starting point).
4.  **Calculate `N_total = R + C`**.
5.  **Generate Primes**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to `N_total`. (Maximum `N_total` is 9998).
6.  **Count Prime Exponents**:
    *   Define a helper function `countFactorialExponent(n, p)` that calculates the exponent of prime `p` in `n!` using Legendre's Formula.
    *   Initialize `result = 1n` (BigInt).
    *   For each prime `p` found in step 5:
        *   Calculate `exponent_N_total = countFactorialExponent(N_total, p)`.
        *   Calculate `exponent_R = countFactorialExponent(R, p)`.
        *   Calculate `exponent_C = countFactorialExponent(C, p)`.
        *   The final exponent for `p` in the binomial coefficient is `final_exponent_p = exponent_N_total - exponent_R - exponent_C`.
        *   If `final_exponent_p > 0`, multiply `result` by `BigInt(p)` raised to the power of `BigInt(final_exponent_p)`: `result *= (BigInt(p) ** BigInt(final_exponent_p))`.
7.  **Truncate and Print**:
    *   Convert `result` (which is a `BigInt`) to a string.
    *   Take the first 1000 characters of this string. If the string is shorter than 1000 characters, take the entire string.
    *   Print the truncated string.

This prime factorization approach guarantees exact intermediate values for the exponents and allows `BigInt` to only perform exponentiation and multiplication on growing numbers, which is typically optimized in modern JavaScript engines.

### 4. Time Complexity Analysis

*   **Sieve**: `O(N_total log log N_total)`, very fast for `N_total` up to 10000.
*   **Counting Exponents**: For each prime `p`, `countFactorialExponent` takes `O(log_p(N_total))` time. Total over all primes: `sum(log_p(N_total))` which is roughly `O(N_total)`. Also very fast.
*   **BigInt Multiplication**: There are about `1229` primes up to 9998. For each prime, we perform a BigInt power operation `BigInt(p) ** BigInt(final_exponent_p)` (which is relatively small in terms of digits) and then a BigInt multiplication `result *= ...`. The `result` variable grows up to ~3000 digits. If BigInt multiplication is `O(D log D log log D)` or `O(D^1.58)` for `D` digits, the overall complexity would be `O(Number_of_Primes * D^1.58)`. For `1229 * (3000^1.58)`, this is roughly `2 * 10^8` operations, which should pass within typical time limits (1-2 seconds) in competitive programming environments.
