The puzzle asks us to represent a given `length` (a multiple of the `span` unit) using a specific set of anthropomorphic units, adhering to certain rules. The key rules are:
1.  **Unit Relationships:** `palm + full palm = span`, `full palm + span = foot`, `span + foot = cubit`. These are classic Fibonacci relationships.
2.  **Naming Convention:** `span` is `C`, `foot` is `1L`, `cubit` is `2L`, `full palm` is `1R`, `palm` is `2R`, and so on.
3.  **No Adjacent Units:** We must not use two adjacent units (e.g., a `span` and a `foot` must be replaced by a `cubit`). This is a direct hint towards Zeckendorf's theorem.
4.  **Least Amount of Units:** The representation must use the minimum number of units. This is also a property of Zeckendorf's theorem.

**Understanding the Unit Values (Fibonacci Connection)**

Let's denote the value of a unit by `Val(Unit)`.
From the relationships:
*   `Val(2R) + Val(1R) = Val(C)`
*   `Val(1R) + Val(C) = Val(1L)`
*   `Val(C) + Val(1L) = Val(2L)`

This forms a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, which is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.
For these units to have positive, non-zero lengths, we need to choose an appropriate Fibonacci sequence. A common variant is `F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8, ...` (where `F_n` here is equivalent to `F_{n+1}` in the standard `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...` sequence).

Let's map the units to this Fibonacci sequence:
*   `2R` (palm) -> `F_1 = 1`
*   `1R` (full palm) -> `F_2 = 2`
*   `C` (span) -> `F_3 = 3`
*   `1L` (foot) -> `F_4 = 5`
*   `2L` (cubit) -> `F_5 = 8`
*   And so on: `nL` maps to `F_{n+3}`, and `nR` maps to `F_{3-n}`.

Let's verify the relationships with these values:
*   `Val(2R) + Val(1R) = 1 + 2 = 3 = Val(C)`. Correct.
*   `Val(1R) + Val(C) = 2 + 3 = 5 = Val(1L)`. Correct.
*   `Val(C) + Val(1L) = 3 + 5 = 8 = Val(2L)`. Correct.

This mapping provides positive lengths for all units and satisfies the rules.

**Handling the Input `length`**

The problem states: "You are given a multiple of the **span**, for example three spans". The input `length` is this multiple `N`.
The example input `1` (meaning "1 span") results in `C`.
If `length = N`, this means we need to represent a total length equivalent to `N` times the value of `C`.
Based on our mapping, `Val(C) = F_3 = 3`.
So, the `targetValue` to represent is `N * 3`.

**Zeckendorf's Theorem**

Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The greedy algorithm for finding this representation is:
1.  Find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the target value.
2.  Subtract it from the target value.
3.  Repeat until the target value becomes zero.

This greedy approach naturally ensures that no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are chosen, which satisfies the "not use two adjacent units" rule. It also uses the least amount of Fibonacci numbers, satisfying the "least amount of units used" rule.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Generate Fibonacci numbers:** Create an array of Fibonacci numbers (using the `F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, ...` sequence) up to a value large enough to cover the maximum possible `targetValue`. Given typical CodinGame constraints, `length` can be up to `2 * 10^9`, so `targetValue` can be `2 * 10^9 * 3 = 6 * 10^9`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so around `F_49` (which is ~7.7 billion in our sequence) is sufficient.
2.  **Calculate target value:** Read the input `length` (`N`), and calculate `targetValue = N * Val(C) = N * 3`.
3.  **Apply Zeckendorf's algorithm:**
    *   Initialize an empty list for `resultUnits`.
    *   Iterate through the generated Fibonacci numbers from largest to smallest.
    *   If the current `fibNum` is less than or equal to `remainingValue`, subtract `fibNum` from `remainingValue` and add the corresponding unit name to `resultUnits`.
    *   Stop when `remainingValue` is 0.
4.  **Map Fibonacci index to unit name:** Create a helper function `getUnitName(fibIndex)` that converts the Fibonacci index (e.g., `1` for `F_1`, `2` for `F_2`, etc.) to its corresponding unit name (`2R`, `1R`, `C`, `1L`, `2L`, etc.).
5.  **Output:** Join the `resultUnits` with spaces. The greedy algorithm naturally adds units in descending order of value, which is the desired output order.

**Example: `length = 1`**
1.  `targetValue = 1 * 3 = 3`.
2.  Fibonacci sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]`
3.  Largest Fib `<= 3` is `3` (`F_3`).
4.  `remainingValue = 3 - 3 = 0`. `resultUnits.push(getUnitName(3))` which is "C".
5.  `remainingValue` is `0`, stop.
6.  Output: "C". Correct.

**Example: `length = 2`**
1.  `targetValue = 2 * 3 = 6`.
2.  Fibonacci sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]`
3.  Largest Fib `<= 6` is `5` (`F_4`).
4.  `remainingValue = 6 - 5 = 1`. `resultUnits.push(getUnitName(4))` which is "1L".
5.  Largest Fib `<= 1` is `1` (`F_1`). (Note: `F_2=2` is skipped as `remainingValue=1` < `2`).
6.  `remainingValue = 1 - 1 = 0`. `resultUnits.push(getUnitName(1))` which is "2R".
7.  `remainingValue` is `0`, stop.
8.  Output: "1L 2R".

This approach correctly solves the puzzle.
