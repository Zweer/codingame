The problem asks us to find the total number of unique paths from the top-left corner `(0,0)` to the bottom-right corner `(M-1, N-1)` of a 2D grid. We can only move right or down. Cells marked `1` are walls and cannot be traversed, while `0`s are free cells.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. We can define `dp[r][c]` as the number of paths to reach cell `(r, c)` from `(0,0)`.

**1. Base Cases:**
*   If the starting cell `(0,0)` is a wall (`grid[0][0] === 1`), then no paths are possible to any cell, including the destination. In this case, `dp[0][0]` will be `0`.
*   If `grid[0][0]` is a free cell (`0`), there is exactly one way to be at `(0,0)` (by starting there). So, `dp[0][0] = 1`.

**2. Recurrence Relation:**
To reach any cell `(r, c)` (where `r > 0` and `c > 0`), we can only come from two possible directions:
*   From the cell directly above: `(r-1, c)`
*   From the cell directly to the left: `(r, c-1)`

Therefore, if `grid[r][c]` is a free cell (`0`), the number of paths to `(r, c)` is the sum of paths to `(r-1, c)` and paths to `(r, c-1)`:
`dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]`

If `grid[r][c]` is a wall (`1`), then `dp[r][c] = 0` as it's an unreachable cell.

**3. Filling the DP Table:**
We need to fill the `dp` table in an order that ensures the values required for the recurrence relation are already computed. A row-by-row or column-by-column traversal works.

*   **Initialize `dp` table:** Create an `M x N` 2D array, initialized with zeros.
*   **Handle `(0,0)`:** Set `dp[0][0] = 1` if `grid[0][0]` is `0`, otherwise `0`. If `grid[0][0]` is `1`, we can immediately output `0` and terminate.
*   **Fill the first row:** For `c` from `1` to `N-1`:
    *   If `grid[0][c]` is `0` (not a wall) AND `dp[0][c-1]` is reachable (meaning `dp[0][c-1] > 0`), then `dp[0][c] = 1`. This is because there's only one way to reach `(0,c)` from `(0,0)` by moving purely right along the first row. If `dp[0][c-1]` was `0` (due to a wall earlier in the row), then `dp[0][c]` must also be `0`.
*   **Fill the first column:** For `r` from `1` to `M-1`:
    *   Similarly, if `grid[r][0]` is `0` AND `dp[r-1][0]` is reachable (`dp[r-1][0] > 0`), then `dp[r][0] = 1`. This accounts for paths moving purely down along the first column.
*   **Fill the rest of the table:** For `r` from `1` to `M-1` and `c` from `1` to `N-1`:
    *   If `grid[r][c]` is `0`, apply the recurrence `dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]`.
    *   If `grid[r][c]` is `1`, `dp[r][c]` remains `0`.

**4. Result:**
The final answer is `dp[M-1][N-1]`, which represents the total number of paths to reach the bottom-right cell.

**Constraints (`M, N <= 10`)**: The maximum number of paths for a 10x10 grid with no obstacles is `(18 choose 9) = 48620`, which easily fits within standard integer types. Dynamic programming is efficient for these constraints, with a time complexity of O(M*N).
