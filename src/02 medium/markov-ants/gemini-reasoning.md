The problem asks us to calculate the average time an ant takes to reach the border of an anthill, starting from a specific internal position. The ant moves randomly in one of four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) by a fixed `step` distance each second. This is a classic example of a random walk on a grid with absorbing boundaries, which can be modeled using a system of linear equations derived from expected values.

**Understanding the Problem as a Markov Chain:**

Let `E(x, y)` be the expected number of seconds (steps) for the ant to reach an absorbing state (the border or outside) starting from an internal position `(x, y)`.

*   **Absorbing States:** Any position `(x, y)` that is on the border (`x=0`, `x=w-1`, `y=0`, `y=h-1`) or outside the anthill. For these states, the ant has already found food, so `E(x, y) = 0`.
*   **Transient States:** Any position `(x, y)` strictly inside the anthill (`1 <= x <= w-2` and `1 <= y <= h-2`). These are the states we need to calculate `E` for.

From any transient state `(x, y)`, the ant takes one second (one step) and then moves to one of four possible new positions with equal probability (1/4 each):
1.  `(x, y - step)` (North)
2.  `(x, y + step)` (South)
3.  `(x + step, y)` (East)
4.  `(x - step, y)` (West)

The expected value formula for a transient state `(x, y)` is:
`E(x, y) = 1 + (1/4) * E(x, y - step) + (1/4) * E(x, y + step) + (1/4) * E(x + step, y) + (1/4) * E(x - step, y)`

This equation holds for every internal cell. If any of the `(x, y +/-, step)` or `(x +/-, step, y)` positions are absorbing, their corresponding `E` value is 0, effectively removing that term from the sum.

**Setting up the System of Linear Equations:**

We can rearrange the equation for `E(x, y)`:
`E(x, y) - (1/4) * E(x, y - step) - (1/4) * E(x, y + step) - (1/4) * E(x + step, y) - (1/4) * E(x - step, y) = 1`

This forms a system of linear equations `Ax = B`, where:
*   `x` is a vector containing the unknown `E` values for all internal states.
*   `A` is the coefficient matrix. For an equation corresponding to `E(x,y)`:
    *   The coefficient for `E(x,y)` itself is `1`.
    *   The coefficients for its internal neighbors `E(nx, ny)` are `-1/4`.
    *   Coefficients for absorbing neighbors are implicitly `0` (they don't appear in the `x` vector).
*   `B` is a constant vector where each element is `1` (representing the `1` step taken).

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Input Parsing:** Read `step`, `w`, `h`, and the grid. Identify the starting `(startX, startY)` coordinates of 'A'.
2.  **State Mapping:**
    *   Create an array `internalCells` to store the `[x, y]` coordinates of all internal cells. The index in this array will be the corresponding index in our `x` vector (and rows/columns of `A`).
    *   Create a `Map` (e.g., `coordToIndex`) to quickly look up the 1D index given `(x, y)` coordinates.
3.  **Matrix Construction:**
    *   Initialize an `N x N` matrix `A` with zeros and an `N x 1` vector `B` with ones, where `N` is the number of internal cells.
    *   Iterate through each internal cell `(currentX, currentY)` (mapped to index `k`):
        *   Set `A[k][k] = 1.0`.
        *   For each of the four possible next positions `(nextX, nextY)`:
            *   Check if `(nextX, nextY)` is an absorbing state (i.e., `nextX <= 0`, `nextX >= w-1`, `nextY <= 0`, or `nextY >= h-1`).
            *   If it's an internal state, get its index `j` from `coordToIndex`. Set `A[k][j] -= 0.25`.
            *   If it's an absorbing state, it contributes `0` to the sum, so no change is needed to `A` or `B` for this term.
4.  **Solve the System:** Use Gaussian elimination to solve `Ax = B` for the vector `x`. Given the constraints (`w, h <= 15`, so `N <= 13*13 = 169`), Gaussian elimination is efficient enough.
5.  **Output Result:** Find the index `startIdx` corresponding to the ant's initial position `(startX, startY)`. The average time is `x[startIdx]`. Format the result to one decimal place.

**Gaussian Elimination:**
The `gaussianElimination` function takes the coefficient matrix `A` and the constant vector `B`. It constructs an augmented matrix `[A|B]` and performs row operations to transform `A` into an identity matrix. This process involves:
*   **Forward Elimination:** Iterating through columns, using row operations to create zeros below the diagonal. Partial pivoting (swapping rows to get the largest absolute value on the diagonal) is used for numerical stability.
*   **Back Substitution (or direct result):** After forward elimination, the matrix `A` becomes an upper triangular matrix. Further elimination makes it a diagonal matrix (or identity matrix if scaled). The solution `x` will then be directly available in the augmented column `B`.

**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**
`step = 1`, `w = 5`, `h = 5`. 'A' is at `(2,2)` (column 2, row 2).
Internal cells: `(x,y)` where `1 <= x <= 3` and `1 <= y <= 3`. Total `3*3=9` internal cells.
The ant at `(2,2)` has neighbors `(2,1)` (N), `(2,3)` (S), `(3,2)` (E), `(1,2)` (W). All these are internal cells.
The equation for `E(2,2)` would be:
`E(2,2) - 0.25*E(2,1) - 0.25*E(2,3) - 0.25*E(3,2) - 0.25*E(1,2) = 1`
This contributes to the row in matrix `A` corresponding to `E(2,2)`. Other internal cells on the edge (e.g., `E(1,1)`) would have some neighbors that are absorbing, causing fewer `-0.25` terms in their equations.
