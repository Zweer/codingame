The RUSH HOUR puzzle requires finding the shortest sequence of moves to guide a red car (ID 0) to a specific exit on a 6x6 grid. Other vehicles obstruct the path, and they can only move along their axis (horizontal cars LEFT/RIGHT, vertical cars UP/DOWN). The red car is always horizontal, 2 units long, and on the 3rd line (y=2). The exit is at x=4, y=2.

This problem is a classic shortest path problem on an unweighted graph, which is perfectly suited for Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Reasoning:**

1.  **State Representation:**
    *   A "state" in our BFS will be the configuration of all cars on the board at a given moment. This can be represented as an array of `Car` objects, where each `Car` stores its `id`, `x`, `y` coordinates, `length`, and `axis` ('H' or 'V').
    *   To detect collisions efficiently, a 2D `grid` (6x6) can be derived from the `Car` array, where each cell stores the ID of the car occupying it (or 0 for empty).
    *   To prevent redundant calculations and infinite loops (cycles), we need a `visited` set to store hashes of states we've already explored. A robust hash for a state can be created by sorting the `Car` objects by ID and then concatenating their `id:x,y` strings (e.g., `0:1,2;3:4,2;...`).

2.  **BFS Algorithm:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Create a queue for BFS, initialized with the starting board state (initial car positions, and an empty list of moves).
        *   Add the hash of the initial state to the `visited` set.
    *   **Loop:** While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue the current state (`currentState`).
        *   **Goal Check:** Check if the red car in `currentState` has reached `x=4, y=2`. If so, we've found the shortest path. Return the list of moves stored in `currentState`.
        *   **Generate Next States:** For each car in `currentState`:
            *   Determine all possible single-step moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) based on its axis.
            *   For each potential move:
                *   Calculate the car's new position.
                *   Check for collisions: Ensure the new position is within the 6x6 grid boundaries and does not overlap with any other car. This is where the `grid` derived from `currentState` is useful.
                *   If the move is valid:
                    *   Create a `newCar` array (a deep clone of `currentState.cars` with the moved car updated).
                    *   Generate the hash for this `newCar` configuration.
                    *   If this `newStateHash` is not in the `visited` set:
                        *   Add it to `visited`.
                        *   Create a `newState` object (containing `newCar` and `currentState.moves` plus the current move string like "ID DIRECTION").
                        *   Enqueue `newState`.

3.  **Handling CodinGame's Turn-Based Input/Output:**
    *   The crucial detail is the time limit: 5 seconds for the first turn, 100 ms for subsequent turns. This strongly suggests that the full BFS (which can be computationally intensive) should *only* be performed once on the first turn.
    *   **First Turn:** Read the initial car configurations. Call the `solveRushHour` BFS function to get the *entire sequence* of moves for the shortest path. Store this sequence in a global variable (e.g., `solutionPath`). Output the first move from `solutionPath`.
    *   **Subsequent Turns:** Read the current car configurations (which will be the state after our previous move). Simply output the next move from the pre-calculated `solutionPath` using an index counter. The input car configurations are provided for consistency but are not needed for re-computation once the path is found.

**Code Structure:**

*   `Car` interface: Defines the properties of a car.
*   `BoardState` interface: Holds the `cars` array and the `moves` list for a BFS state.
*   `createGrid(cars: Car[]): number[][]`: Helper to build the grid for collision detection.
*   `hashBoardState(cars: Car[]): string`: Helper to create a unique string representation of a board state.
*   `cloneCars(cars: Car[]): Car[]`: Helper for deep copying car configurations.
*   `solveRushHour(initialCars: Car[]): string[]`: The main BFS function that returns the full sequence of moves.
*   **Main Loop:** Reads input, calls `solveRushHour` once, and then outputs moves from the stored `solutionPath`.
