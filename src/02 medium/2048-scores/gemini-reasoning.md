The puzzle asks us to determine the player's score and the number of turns played in a 2048 game, given the final 4x4 grid and the total count of '4' tiles that were generated throughout the game.

Let's break down the rules and properties to find a solution:

**Game Mechanics & Properties:**
1.  **Grid:** 4x4.
2.  **Initial State:** "You start with 2 tiles placed randomly in the grid." The values of these initial tiles are not explicitly stated, but are usually '2's in common 2048 variants. This is a crucial ambiguity we need to resolve.
3.  **Turn:** All tiles move in a direction. Adjacent same-value tiles merge (`X + X -> 2X`). The score increases by the value of the new tile (`2X`). A new tile (value '2' or '4') is generated in a random empty spot.
4.  **Input:** Final grid state and `FOURS` (total number of '4' tiles generated).

**Definitions:**
*   `S_final`: Sum of all tile values in the final grid.
*   `N_i2`: Count of initial '2' tiles.
*   `N_i4`: Count of initial '4' tiles.
*   `N_g2`: Total count of '2' tiles generated during the game (after initial setup).
*   `N_g4 = FOURS`: Total count of '4' tiles generated during the game.
*   `TURNS`: Total number of turns played.
*   `SCORE`: Total score.

**Key Invariants & Deductions:**

1.  **Conservation of Sum of Values:** In 2048, when tiles merge (`X + X -> 2X`), the sum of values on the board remains unchanged (`X + X = 2X`). The sum of values on the board *only* changes when new tiles are generated.
    Therefore, `S_final = (N_i2 * 2 + N_i4 * 4) + (N_g2 * 2 + N_g4 * 4)`.
    This means `S_final` is the sum of values of all tiles that were ever *introduced* into the game (initial or generated).

2.  **Conservation of "2-Equivalents":** Every tile `V` on the board is ultimately composed of `V/2` units of '2'. For example, a '4' is two '2's, an '8' is four '2's.
    Let `S_2_equiv_final = Sum(V/2)` for all `V > 0` in the final grid. This is the total number of '2'-value units present in the final state.
    These '2'-units must come from:
    *   Initial tiles: `N_i2 * 1 + N_i4 * 2`
    *   Generated tiles: `N_g2 * 1 + N_g4 * 2`
    So, `S_2_equiv_final = N_i2 + 2*N_i4 + N_g2 + 2*N_g4`.

3.  **Number of Initial Tiles:** The problem states "You start with 2 tiles". So, `N_i2 + N_i4 = 2`.

4.  **Solving the System of Equations:**
    We have three variables (`N_i2`, `N_i4`, `N_g2`) and three equations:
    a. `N_i2 + N_i4 = 2`
    b. `S_2_equiv_final = N_i2 + 2*N_i4 + N_g2 + 2*N_g4`
    c. `S_final = (N_i2 * 2 + N_i4 * 4) + (N_g2 * 2 + N_g4 * 4)`

    From (a), `N_i2 = 2 - N_i4`. Substitute into (b):
    `S_2_equiv_final = (2 - N_i4) + 2*N_i4 + N_g2 + 2*N_g4`
    `S_2_equiv_final = 2 + N_i4 + N_g2 + 2*N_g4`
    `N_i4 + N_g2 = S_2_equiv_final - 2 - 2*N_g4` (Equation B')

    Substitute `N_i2 = 2 - N_i4` into (c):
    `S_final = ((2 - N_i4) * 2 + N_i4 * 4) + (N_g2 * 2 + N_g4 * 4)`
    `S_final = (4 - 2*N_i4 + 4*N_i4) + 2*N_g2 + 4*N_g4`
    `S_final = 4 + 2*N_i4 + 2*N_g2 + 4*N_g4`
    `2*(N_i4 + N_g2) = S_final - 4 - 4*N_g4`
    `N_i4 + N_g2 = (S_final - 4 - 4*N_g4) / 2` (Equation C')

    Equating the expressions for `N_i4 + N_g2` from (B') and (C'):
    `S_2_equiv_final - 2 - 2*N_g4 = (S_final - 4 - 4*N_g4) / 2`
    Multiplying by 2:
    `2 * S_2_equiv_final - 4 - 4*N_g4 = S_final - 4 - 4*N_g4`
    `2 * S_2_equiv_final = S_final`
    This identity `S_final = 2 * S_2_equiv_final` is always true for any 2048 board (where all numbers are powers of 2). It doesn't help solve `N_i4` or `N_g2` further on its own.

    However, using the example values:
    Final grid values: `4, 4, 4`. So `S_final = 12`.
    `S_2_equiv_final = (4/2) + (4/2) + (4/2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
    `N_g4 = FOURS = 2`.

    Now plug into `N_i4 + N_g2 = S_2_equiv_final - 2 - 2*N_g4`:
    `N_i4 + N_g2 = 6 - 2 - 2 * 2`
    `N_i4 + N_g2 = 6 - 2 - 4`
    `N_i4 + N_g2 = 0`

    Since `N_i4` and `N_g2` represent counts of tiles, they must be non-negative integers. The only way their sum can be zero is if `N_i4 = 0` and `N_g2 = 0`.
    This is a critical deduction:
    *   `N_i4 = 0`: The two initial tiles were both '2's. (`N_i2 = 2`).
    *   `N_g2 = 0`: No '2' tiles were ever generated during the turns; all generated tiles were '4's.

**Calculating `TURNS`:**
The total number of turns is the sum of all generated tiles.
`TURNS = N_g2 + N_g4 = 0 + FOURS`.
So, `TURNS = FOURS`.

**Calculating `SCORE`:**
The problem states: "When 2 tiles merge, the userâ€™s score increases by the value of the new tile."
The example then clarifies `score = 2+2=4`, indicating that when a `2` and `2` merge to `4`, the score increases by `4`. This is the direct value of the resulting tile.
Given our deductions (`N_i2=2`, `N_i4=0`, `N_g2=0`, `N_g4=FOURS`):
*   Any '2's on the final board must be the original two '2's that never merged. They contribute 0 to the score.
*   Any '4's on the final board could be:
    *   Generated '4's: There are `FOURS` such tiles. They contribute 0 to the score.
    *   Merged '4's (from `2+2`): The number of these is `(Total count of 4s on board) - FOURS`. Each contributes `4` to the score.
*   Any tile `V > 4` on the final board (e.g., 8, 16, 32, ...):
    *   These tiles *must* have been formed by merges (e.g., an 8 from `4+4`, a 16 from `8+8`, etc.).
    *   Each such merge adds its value `V` to the score.

So, the score formula is:
`SCORE = (Count of 4s on board - FOURS) * 4 + Sum(V for each V > 4 on board)`

Let's apply to the example input:
Grid:
```
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
0 0 0 0
4 4 0 0
```
`FOURS = 2`

1.  **Count tiles in final grid:**
    *   Three '4' tiles. `tileCounts.get(4) = 3`. No other values present.
2.  **Calculate TURNS:**
    `TURNS = FOURS = 2`. (Matches example output)
3.  **Calculate SCORE:**
    *   Count of 4s on board = 3.
    *   `foursFromMerges = max(0, 3 - FOURS) = max(0, 3 - 2) = 1`.
    *   Contribution from 4s: `1 * 4 = 4`.
    *   Sum of V for V > 4: 0 (no tiles > 4 on board).
    *   `SCORE = 4 + 0 = 4`. (Matches example output)

This logic is consistent with the example and provides a complete solution.
