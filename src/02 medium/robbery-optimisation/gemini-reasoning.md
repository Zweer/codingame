The problem asks us to find the maximum total value of houses Rob can rob, given that if he robs a house `i`, he cannot rob the two houses to its left (`i-1`, `i-2`) and the two houses to its right (`i+1`, `i+2`). House values can be negative.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. Let's define `dp[i]` as the maximum money Rob can make considering houses from index `0` up to `i`.

**Understanding the constraint:**
If Rob robs house `i`:
1. He cannot rob `i-1` and `i-2`. This means any previous house he robbed must be at index `i-3` or earlier.
2. He cannot rob `i+1` and `i+2`. This is handled by processing houses in increasing order of index; we only care about `i-1, i-2, i-3` for current decision.

**Dynamic Programming Recurrence:**

For each house `i`, Rob has two choices:

1.  **Don't rob house `i`**: In this case, the maximum money he can make up to house `i` is the same as the maximum money he could make up to house `i-1`. So, this option yields `dp[i-1]`.

2.  **Rob house `i`**: If he robs house `i` (value `values[i]`), he is forced to skip `values[i-1]` and `values[i-2]`. Therefore, the maximum money he could have obtained from previous houses must come from houses up to `i-3`. So, this option yields `values[i] + dp[i-3]`. (We need to handle `dp` for negative indices appropriately, typically by treating them as 0, or by explicitly defining base cases).

Combining these, for `i >= 3`:
`dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], values[i] + dp[i-3])`

**Base Cases:**

We need to define the `dp` values for `i = 0, 1, 2` explicitly, as the `i-3` term would go out of bounds or not accurately reflect options.

*   **`N = 0`**: (Not allowed by constraints `1 <= N <= 100`, but good to handle defensively). Max money is 0.
*   **`N = 1`**: `values = [v0]`
    *   `dp[0] = values[0]`. (Only option is to rob the single house).
*   **`N = 2`**: `values = [v0, v1]`
    *   `dp[0] = values[0]`
    *   `dp[1] = Math.max(values[0], values[1])`. (Robbing `v0` makes `v1` forbidden. Robbing `v1` makes `v0` forbidden. So we choose the better of the two).
*   **`N = 3`**: `values = [v0, v1, v2]`
    *   `dp[0] = values[0]`
    *   `dp[1] = Math.max(values[0], values[1])`
    *   `dp[2]`:
        *   Option A: Rob `v2`. Then `v0` and `v1` are skipped. The money is `values[2]`.
        *   Option B: Rob `v0` and `v2`. This is allowed because `v2` is 3 houses away from `v0` (`v0 - v1 - v2`). The money is `values[0] + values[2]`.
        *   Option C: Don't rob `v2`. Max money from `v0, v1` which is `dp[1]`.
        *   So, `dp[2] = Math.max(values[2], values[0] + values[2], dp[1])`.

After computing `dp` values up to `N-1`, the final answer will be `dp[N-1]`.

**Constraints Check:**
*   `N` up to 100: `O(N)` time complexity for DP is efficient enough.
*   `housevalue` up to `10^13`: TypeScript's `number` type (64-bit float) can safely represent integers up to `2^53 - 1` (approx `9 * 10^15`). The maximum possible sum (`100 * 10^13 = 10^15`) fits within this safe integer range, so `parseInt` and `number` type are suitable.

**Example Trace (`values = [1, 15, 10, 13, 16]`, N=5):**

*   `dp[0] = values[0] = 1`
*   `dp[1] = Math.max(values[0], values[1]) = Math.max(1, 15) = 15`
*   `dp[2] = Math.max(values[2], values[0] + values[2], dp[1]) = Math.max(10, 1 + 10, 15) = Math.max(10, 11, 15) = 15`
*   `i = 3`: `values[3] = 13`
    *   `dp[3] = Math.max(dp[2], values[3] + dp[0]) = Math.max(15, 13 + 1) = Math.max(15, 14) = 15`
*   `i = 4`: `values[4] = 16`
    *   `dp[4] = Math.max(dp[3], values[4] + dp[1]) = Math.max(15, 16 + 15) = Math.max(15, 31) = 31`

The final answer is `dp[4] = 31`, matching the example.
