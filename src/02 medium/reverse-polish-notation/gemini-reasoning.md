The puzzle requires interpreting Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) instructions. We need to simulate a stack and perform operations based on the input tokens. The output should be the final state of the stack, or an error message if an operation cannot be performed.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Stack Representation:** A simple JavaScript array (`number[]`) is used to represent the stack. `push` adds elements to the top (end of the array), and `pop` removes elements from the top.

2.  **Input Processing:**
    *   Read the number of instructions `N` (though not directly used in the core logic, it's part of the input protocol).
    *   Read the line of instructions and split it into an array of strings (tokens).
    *   Iterate through each token.

3.  **Token Interpretation:**
    *   **Numbers:** If a token can be parsed as an integer, it's pushed onto the stack.
    *   **Operators (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `MOD`):**
        *   These are binary operations, requiring two operands.
        *   First, check if the stack has at least two elements. If not, an error occurs.
        *   Pop the top two elements (let's call them `b` and `a`, where `b` was on top).
        *   For `DIV` and `MOD`, check if `b` (the divisor) is zero. If so, an error occurs.
        *   Perform the arithmetic operation (`a op b`).
        *   `DIV` uses `Math.trunc()` for integer division. `MOD` uses the standard `%` operator.
        *   Push the result back onto the stack.
    *   **Stack Manipulation (`POP`, `DUP`, `SWP`, `ROL`):**
        *   **`POP`:** Removes the top element. Requires at least one element.
        *   **`DUP`:** Duplicates the top element. Requires at least one element.
        *   **`SWP`:** Swaps the top two elements. Requires at least two elements. Pops `b`, then `a`, then pushes `b`, then `a`.
        *   **`ROL`:** This is the most complex. It expects a number `X` to be on top of the stack.
            *   Pop `X` from the stack.
            *   Check if `X` is a positive integer and if the remaining stack has at least `X` elements. If not, an error occurs.
            *   The operation moves the `X`-th element from the *current top* of the stack (after `X` itself was popped) to the very top.
            *   This is achieved by using `splice` to remove the element at `stack.length - X` (0-indexed from the bottom) and then `push`ing it back onto the stack.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   A boolean flag `errorOccurred` is used.
    *   When an error condition is met (e.g., insufficient operands, division by zero, invalid `ROL` parameter):
        *   The necessary values are popped *before* the error is declared, as per the problem description ("The popped values before the crash are still popped.").
        *   The `errorOccurred` flag is set to `true`.
        *   The processing loop immediately `break`s, stopping further instruction execution.

5.  **Output:**
    *   After the loop finishes:
        *   If `errorOccurred` is `true`, print the current state of the stack (space-separated) followed by " ERROR".
        *   Otherwise, print the final state of the stack (space-separated).

This approach correctly handles all operations and error conditions specified in the problem, including the precise behavior of `ROL` and the error output format.
