The problem describes a two-player game played with a number `N` on a calculator. Players take turns subtracting a digit `d` (1-9) from `N`. The key rules are:
1. The first player can pick any digit `d` from 1 to 9.
2. Subsequent players must pick a digit `d'` that is adjacent to the previously chosen digit `d`. They cannot pick the same digit.
3. A player loses if their move makes `N` negative. This implies that making `N` become `0` is a winning move, as the next player will be forced to make `N` negative.

This is a typical impartial game problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming or memoized recursion (minimax with memoization). We'll use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach.

**State Definition:**
A game state can be defined by `(current_N, last_digit_chosen)`.
- `current_N`: The current value of `N`.
- `last_digit_chosen`: The digit played by the *previous* player. This is needed to determine valid moves for the *current* player. We can use `0` to represent the initial state where no digit has been chosen yet (and thus any digit 1-9 is valid).

**DP Table:**
Let `dp[n][last_d]` be a boolean value indicating whether the player whose turn it is to move from state `(n, last_d)` can win the game.

**Base Case:**
- If `n <= 0`: If the current value of `N` is 0 or less, any valid move (subtracting a digit `d` from 1 to 9) will result in `N - d` being negative. According to the rules, the player who makes `N` negative loses. Therefore, `dp[n][last_d]` is `false` for `n <= 0`.

**Recursive Relation (Bottom-Up Calculation):**
To calculate `dp[n][last_d]` for `n > 0`:
The current player can win from `(n, last_d)` if there exists at least one valid move `d_prime` such that:
1. `n - d_prime >= 0`: The current player does not lose immediately by making `n` negative.
2. `dp[n - d_prime][d_prime]` is `false`: The opponent (who will face state `(n - d_prime, d_prime)`) loses from that state.

If no such `d_prime` exists (i.e., all valid moves `d_prime` either make `n` negative, or lead to a state `(n - d_prime, d_prime)` where the opponent wins), then `dp[n][last_d]` is `true`.

**Adjacency Rules:**
We'll define the adjacency rules using a map for quick lookup.



**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `(MAX_N + 1) x 10`. `MAX_N` is 999 based on constraints.
2. Iterate `n` from `0` to `MAX_N` (inclusive).
3. For each `n`, iterate `last_d` from `0` to `9` (inclusive).
4. Apply the base case: If `n <= 0`, set `dp[n][last_d]` to `false` and continue.
5. Determine `possibleMovesForCurrentTurn`:
   - If `last_d` is `0`, `possibleMovesForCurrentTurn` are `[1, 2, ..., 9]`.
   - Otherwise, `possibleMovesForCurrentTurn` are `ADJACENT_DIGITS[last_d]`.
6. Initialize `canCurrentPlayerWin` to `false`.
7. Iterate through each `d_prime` in `possibleMovesForCurrentTurn`:
   - Calculate `nextN = n - d_prime`.
   - If `nextN < 0`: This move makes the current player lose. Skip this `d_prime` as it's not a winning move.
   - If `nextN >= 0`: Check `dp[nextN][d_prime]`. If `dp[nextN][d_prime]` is `false` (meaning the opponent loses from this state), then `canCurrentPlayerWin` becomes `true`, and we can `break` from this inner loop (as we've found at least one winning move for the current player).
8. Set `dp[n][last_d]` to `canCurrentPlayerWin`.

**Finding Winning Moves for Initial N:**
After the `dp` table is fully populated:
1. Read the input `N`.
2. Initialize an empty list `winningMovesForN`.
3. For each digit `d` from `1` to `9`:
   - Calculate `nextN = N - d`.
   - If `nextN < 0`: This move makes the first player lose. `d` is not a winning move.
   - If `nextN >= 0`: If `dp[nextN][d]` is `false` (meaning the second player loses from the resulting state), then `d` is a winning move for the first player. Add `d` to `winningMovesForN`.
4. Sort `winningMovesForN` in ascending order and print them space-separated.

**Example Trace (N=2):**
Let's see how `dp` is filled for small `N`:
- `dp[0][any]` = `false` (base case)
- `n=1`:
  - `dp[1][1]` (prev was 1, moves are 2,4,5): `1-2=-1`, `1-4=-3`, `1-5=-4`. All make `N` negative. So `dp[1][1]` = `false`.
  - `dp[1][2]` (prev was 2, moves are 1,3,4,5,6): Try `d=1`. `nextN=1-1=0`. `dp[0][1]` is `false`. So `!dp[0][1]` is `true`. `dp[1][2]` = `true`. (Player can pick 1 and win).
  - Similar logic for other `last_d` for `n=1`. `dp[1][last_d]` is `true` if `1` is adjacent to `last_d`, otherwise `false`.
- `n=2`:
  - `dp[2][1]` (prev was 1, moves are 2,4,5):
    - `d=2`: `nextN=0`. `dp[0][2]` is `false`. `!dp[0][2]` is `true`. So `dp[2][1]` = `true`.
  - `dp[2][2]` (prev was 2, moves are 1,3,4,5,6):
    - `d=1`: `nextN=1`. `dp[1][1]` is `false` (from above). `!dp[1][1]` is `true`. So `dp[2][2]` = `true`.
  - And so on for other `last_d`.

Now, find winning moves for initial `N=2`:
- Try `d=1`: `nextN = 2-1 = 1`. Check `!dp[1][1]`. We found `dp[1][1]` is `false`. So `!dp[1][1]` is `true`. `1` is a winning move.
- Try `d=2`: `nextN = 2-2 = 0`. Check `!dp[0][2]`. We found `dp[0][2]` is `false`. So `!dp[0][2]` is `true`. `2` is a winning move.
- Try `d=3`: `nextN = 2-3 = -1`. Current player loses. `3` is not a winning move.
- ... and so on for `d=4` to `9`.

Result: `1 2`. This matches the example.

The time complexity will be `O(MAX_N * NUM_DIGITS * MAX_ADJACENT_DIGITS)`, which is roughly `1000 * 10 * 8 = 80,000` operations, very efficient for the given constraints.
