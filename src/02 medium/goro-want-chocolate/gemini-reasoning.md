The problem asks us to find the minimum number of square pieces a given `H x W` chocolate bar can be chopped into, with no waste. Goro can only cut the chocolate along its major axes (horizontal or vertical lines).

This is a classic problem that can be solved using a greedy approach, which turns out to be optimal. The strategy is to always cut out the largest possible square from the current rectangular piece. This process is very similar to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Let's define a function `f(h, w)` that returns the minimum number of squares for an `h x w` rectangle:

1.  **Base Case:** If `h` is equal to `w`, the piece is already a square. We need `1` square piece. So, `f(h, h) = 1`.

2.  **Recursive Step:** If `h` is not equal to `w`, without loss of generality, let's assume `h > w` (we can always swap `h` and `w` if `w > h`).
    *   We can cut off `k = floor(h / w)` squares, each of size `w x w`, from the `h` side.
    *   After cutting these `k` squares, the remaining piece will have dimensions `(h % w) x w`.
    *   The total number of squares will be `k` (the squares we just cut) plus the minimum number of squares required for the remaining `(h % w) x w` piece, i.e., `f(w, h % w)`.

    So, `f(h, w) = floor(h / w) + f(w, h % w)`.

    There's a special case within the recursive step: if `h % w` is `0`, it means `w` perfectly divides `h`. In this situation, we can cut `h / w` squares of size `w x w`, and there is no remaining piece. So, `f(h, w) = h / w`. This also serves as a base case for the recursion where the modulo operation results in zero.

Let's trace the example `3 x 5`:

1.  `f(3, 5)`: `3 < 5`, so swap to `f(5, 3)`.
2.  `f(5, 3)`:
    *   `5 % 3 = 2` (not 0).
    *   `numSquaresCut = floor(5 / 3) = 1`. We cut one `3x3` square.
    *   Remaining piece: `(5 % 3) x 3 = 2 x 3`.
    *   Result: `1 + f(3, 2)`.
3.  `f(3, 2)` (from the previous step):
    *   `3 % 2 = 1` (not 0).
    *   `numSquaresCut = floor(3 / 2) = 1`. We cut one `2x2` square.
    *   Remaining piece: `(3 % 2) x 2 = 1 x 2`.
    *   Result: `1 + f(2, 1)`.
4.  `f(2, 1)` (from the previous step):
    *   `2 % 1 = 0`.
    *   Result: `2 / 1 = 2`. We cut two `1x1` squares.
5.  Backtrack:
    *   `f(3, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
    *   `f(5, 3)` returns `1 + 3 = 4`.

The final answer for `3 x 5` is `4`, which matches the example.

The constraints `1 <= H, W <= 150` are small enough that this recursive solution will be very fast. The number of recursive calls is logarithmic with respect to the smaller dimension, similar to the efficiency of the Euclidean algorithm.
