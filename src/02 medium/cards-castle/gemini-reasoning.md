The problem asks us to determine the stability of a card castle structure given as a 2D map. We need to check several conditions for instability. The structure is `STABLE` only if all cards are stable.

Let's break down each instability rule and formulate how to check it:

1.  **"A '/' card is missing before a '\' card ('./\' is UNSTABLE)"**:
    This means if we find a `\` card at `(r, c)`, and the character immediately to its left (`map[r][c-1]`) is a `.` (or if `c` is 0, meaning there's nothing to its left), then it's unstable.
    *   **Check**: If `map[r][c] === '\'` and (`c === 0` or `map[r][c-1] === '.'`).

2.  **"A '\' card is missing after a '/' card ('/.' is UNSTABLE)"**:
    This means if we find a `/` card at `(r, c)`, and the character immediately to its right (`map[r][c+1]`) is a `.` (or if `c` is the last column, meaning there's nothing to its right), then it's unstable.
    *   **Check**: If `map[r][c] === '/'` and (`c === width - 1` or `map[r][c+1] === '.'`).

3.  **"Two cards side by side have the same orientation ('//\' or '/\\' is UNSTABLE)"**:
    This rule's wording is a bit ambiguous, especially the mention of `/\\`. However, a fundamental property of card castles is that cards lean against each other. Two cards leaning in the same direction (`//` or `\\`) would collapse. The example `/\/\/\/\` is `STABLE`, implying that `/\` is a stable configuration. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that `//` and `\\` patterns are unstable.
    *   **Check for `//`**: If `map[r][c] === '/'` and `map[r][c+1] === '/'`.
    *   **Check for `\\`**: If `map[r][c] === '\'` and `map[r][c-1] === '\'`. (Note: we check `c-1` for `\` because it leans left, so it interacts with the card to its left).

4.  **"Neither another card nor the ground are below (aka. a 'flying card')"**:
    This means any card that is not on the bottom row (`r < H-1`) must have *some* card directly beneath it.
    *   **Check**: If `r < H-1` and `map[r+1][c] === '.'`.

5.  **"The card below has the same orientation"**:
    This rule applies to vertical stacking. A card cannot be stable if the card directly beneath it has the same orientation (e.g., `/` on top of `/`, or `\` on top of `\`). This allows for `/\` or `\/` configurations in a vertical stack, which are typically stable.
    *   **Check**: If `r < H-1` and `map[r][c] === map[r+1][c]`.

We will iterate through each cell of the map. If a cell contains a `.` (dot), it's empty space and doesn't need to be checked for stability rules that apply to cards. If it's a card (`/` or `\`), we apply the relevant checks. As soon as any rule is violated for any card, the entire structure is `UNSTABLE`, and we can stop processing.

**Algorithm:**
1. Read the height `H`.
2. Read `H` lines into a 2D array (or array of strings) representing the map.
3. Initialize a boolean `isStable = true`.
4. Get the width of the map, which is `H * 2`.
5. Loop `r` from `0` to `H-1` (rows).
6. Loop `c` from `0` to `width-1` (columns).
7. Get the character `card = map[r][c]`.
8. If `card` is `'.'`, continue to the next cell (no checks needed for empty space).
9. Apply the five rules based on `card` and its neighbors. If any rule condition is met, set `isStable = false` and break both loops.
10. After the loops, print `STABLE` if `isStable` is still `true`, otherwise print `UNSTABLE`.

**Example Walkthrough for Vertical Check (Rule 5):**
Consider the example input:
```
.../\...  (row 0)
../\/\..  (row 1)
```
- For `map[0][3] = '/'`: `r=0`, `c=3`. `r < H-1` (0 < 3), so check `map[1][3]`. `map[1][3]` is `\`.
  - Rule 4 (`flying card`): `map[1][3]` is `\` (not `.`), so OK.
  - Rule 5 (`same orientation below`): `map[0][3]` is `/`, `map[1][3]` is `\`. They are different, so OK.
- For `map[0][4] = '\'` : `r=0`, `c=4`. `r < H-1` (0 < 3), so check `map[1][4]`. `map[1][4]` is `/`.
  - Rule 4 (`flying card`): `map[1][4]` is `/` (not `.`), so OK.
  - Rule 5 (`same orientation below`): `map[0][4]` is `\`, `map[1][4]` is `/`. They are different, so OK.

This simplified interpretation of vertical rules works with the given example output.
