The problem asks us to find an octal bitstream that, when fed into a "damaged Gravity Centrifuge," will result in a specific number of tumbles `N`. The key constraint for a damaged centrifuge is that two consecutive bits in the bitstream cannot both be set to 1 (i.e., no `11` pattern). If a bit at index `i` is 1, then the bit at index `i+1` must be 0.

Let's analyze the centrifuge's mechanics:
1.  **Momentum Initialization**: Both drives A and B start with a momentum of 1.
2.  **Bitstream Processing**: Bits are processed from least significant bit (LSB) first.
3.  **Alternating Control**: Bit 0 controls drive A, Bit 1 controls drive B, Bit 2 controls drive A, and so on. In general, bit `k` controls drive A if `k` is even, and drive B if `k` is odd.
4.  **Tumbling**: If the controlling drive's bit is 1, it tumbles the landscape by its current momentum. This does *not* affect its own momentum.
5.  **Momentum Induction**: Regardless of the bit value (0 or 1), the controlling drive accelerates its *twin* by its current momentum. Its own momentum is unaffected.
6.  **Control Shift**: Control then shifts to the other drive for the next bit.

Crucially, the momentum update (rule 5) happens *regardless of bit value*. This means the sequence of momentums available for tumbling remains fixed, whether a bit is 0 or 1.

Let's trace the momentum values of the drive *currently in control* at each bit step:
*   Initial: A=1, B=1
*   **Bit 0 (A controls)**: A's momentum is 1. If set to 1, adds 1 tumble.
    *   A accelerates B by 1. State becomes (A=1, B=1+1=2).
*   **Bit 1 (B controls)**: B's momentum is 2. If set to 1, adds 2 tumbles.
    *   B accelerates A by 2. State becomes (A=1+2=3, B=2).
*   **Bit 2 (A controls)**: A's momentum is 3. If set to 1, adds 3 tumbles.
    *   A accelerates B by 3. State becomes (A=3, B=2+3=5).
*   **Bit 3 (B controls)**: B's momentum is 5. If set to 1, adds 5 tumbles.
    *   B accelerates A by 5. State becomes (A=3+5=8, B=5).
*   **Bit 4 (A controls)**: A's momentum is 8. If set to 1, adds 8 tumbles.
    *   A accelerates B by 8. State becomes (A=8, B=5+8=13).

The sequence of possible tumble values if a bit is set to 1 is `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`. This sequence corresponds to Fibonacci numbers `F_n` starting from `F_2`.
Specifically, if `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`:
*   Bit 0 provides `F_2 = 1` tumble.
*   Bit 1 provides `F_3 = 2` tumbles.
*   Bit 2 provides `F_4 = 3` tumbles.
*   Bit `i` provides `F_{i+2}` tumbles.

The "damaged centrifuge" constraint ("no two consecutive bits in the bitstream are set") translates directly to choosing non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers from this sequence. If we choose to set bit `i` (which provides `F_{i+2}` tumbles), then bit `i+1` *must* be 0. This means we cannot use `F_{(i+1)+2} = F_{i+3}` in our sum. This is exactly the property used in Zeckendorf's theorem, which states that any positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers (using `F_2, F_3, ...`).

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Zeckendorf representation of `N` using `F_2, F_3, F_4, ...`.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Handle N=0**: If `N` is 0, the bitstream is `0`.
2.  **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Create a list of Fibonacci numbers `F_n` starting from `F_2=1` up to `N`. Since `N` can be up to 10^18, we must use `BigInt` for calculations.
    *   Let `F_0 = 0n`, `F_1 = 1n`.
    *   Our list will store `F_2, F_3, F_4, ...`. We'll denote `fib_values[k]` as `F_{k+2}`.
    *   The index `k` in `fib_values[k]` will correspond to the bit position `k` in the final bitstream.
3.  **Zeckendorf Representation (Greedy Approach)**:
    *   Initialize `result_bitstream = 0n` (a `BigInt` to store the bitmask).
    *   Initialize `current_N = N`.
    *   Iterate through the `fib_values` list from the largest Fibonacci number (highest bit position) down to the smallest (bit 0).
    *   For each `fib_values[i]` (which represents `F_{i+2}` and corresponds to `bit_pos = i`):
        *   If `current_N >= fib_values[i]`:
            *   Include `fib_values[i]` in the sum: `current_N -= fib_values[i]`.
            *   Set the corresponding bit: `result_bitstream |= (1n << BigInt(i))`.
            *   To enforce the "no consecutive 1s" rule (or non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers), we must skip the next smaller Fibonacci number. This means if we used `F_{i+2}`, we cannot use `F_{(i-1)+2} = F_{i+1}`. We achieve this by decrementing `i` an *additional* time in the loop. The loop's natural `i--` will move to `i-1`. An explicit `i--` (if `i` is still valid) will then move `i` to `i-2`, effectively skipping `fib_values[i-1]`.
        *   Else (`current_N < fib_values[i]`):
            *   Do nothing (this bit remains 0).
4.  **Output**: Convert the `result_bitstream` `BigInt` to its octal string representation using `toString(8)`.

**Example: N = 7**

1.  `N = 7n` (not 0).
2.  **Generate Fibonacci numbers**:
    *   `f_prev = 1n`, `f_curr = 1n`
    *   `fib_values`:
        *   `f_curr=1n` (`F_2`): `fib_values.push(1n)`. `f_prev=1n, f_curr=2n`.
        *   `f_curr=2n` (`F_3`): `fib_values.push(2n)`. `f_prev=2n, f_curr=3n`.
        *   `f_curr=3n` (`F_4`): `fib_values.push(3n)`. `f_prev=3n, f_curr=5n`.
        *   `f_curr=5n` (`F_5`): `fib_values.push(5n)`. `f_prev=5n, f_curr=8n`.
        *   `f_curr=8n` (`F_6`): `8n > 7n`, so loop terminates.
    *   `fib_values = [1n, 2n, 3n, 5n]`.
        *   `fib_values[0]` is `F_2` (bit 0)
        *   `fib_values[1]` is `F_3` (bit 1)
        *   `fib_values[2]` is `F_4` (bit 2)
        *   `fib_values[3]` is `F_5` (bit 3)
3.  **Zeckendorf**: `result_bitstream = 0n`, `current_N = 7n`.
    *   **i = 3** (`fib_values[3] = 5n`, `bit_pos = 3n`):
        *   `current_N (7n) >= 5n`. True.
        *   `current_N = 7n - 5n = 2n`.
        *   `result_bitstream |= (1n << 3n)` => `result_bitstream = 8n`.
        *   `i--` (i becomes 2).
        *   `i--` again (i becomes 1). (This skips `fib_values[2]=3n`)
    *   **i = 1** (`fib_values[1] = 2n`, `bit_pos = 1n`):
        *   `current_N (2n) >= 2n`. True.
        *   `current_N = 2n - 2n = 0n`.
        *   `result_bitstream |= (1n << 1n)` => `result_bitstream = 8n | 2n = 10n`.
        *   `i--` (i becomes 0).
        *   `i--` again (i becomes -1). (This skips `fib_values[0]=1n`)
    *   Loop terminates as `i < 0`.
4.  **Output**: `10n.toString(8)` which is `'12'`. This matches the example for N=7 (from the "Pristine Example" table's `1010` bitstream, which is 10 in decimal).
