The puzzle asks us to simulate Conway's Game of Life and determine if the given initial configuration leads to a "Still" state, an "Oscillator" (and its period), or "Death".

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Representing the Grid:**
    We'll use a 2D array (`boolean[][]`) where `true` represents a live cell (`#`) and `false` represents a dead cell (` `).

2.  **Game of Life Rules Implementation:**
    For each generation, we need to calculate the state of every cell based on its neighbors in the *previous* generation. This means we'll generate a `nextGrid` from the `currentGrid` without modifying the `currentGrid` in place.
    *   A helper function `countLiveNeighbors(grid, r, c, W, H)` will iterate through the 8 surrounding cells (including diagonals) and count how many are alive, handling boundary conditions (cells on edges/corners have fewer neighbors).
    *   The `getNextGeneration(currentGrid, W, H)` function will create a new empty grid, then iterate through each cell of the `currentGrid`. For each cell, it will apply the Game of Life rules based on its current state and neighbor count to determine its state in the `nextGrid`.

3.  **Detecting End Conditions:**
    To detect Still, Oscillator, or Death, we need to keep track of past configurations.
    *   **Death:** If the `nextGrid` becomes entirely empty (no live cells), the simulation ends in "Death". A helper function `isGridEmpty(grid)` will check this.
    *   **Still/Oscillator:** We need to store a history of configurations encountered so far. A `Map<string, number>` is ideal, where the key is a serialized string representation of the grid and the value is the `step` number at which that configuration was first observed.
        *   After generating a `nextGrid`, we serialize it into a string.
        *   If this serialized string is already in our `historyMap`:
            *   We have found a cycle. The `prevStep` where this configuration was first seen is `historyMap.get(serializedGrid)`.
            *   The `period` of the cycle is `currentStep - prevStep`.
            *   If `period` is 1, it means the current configuration is identical to the previous one, so it's "Still".
            *   If `period` is greater than 1, it's an "Oscillator" with the calculated `period`.
            *   In either case, the simulation ends.
        *   If the serialized string is not in the `historyMap`, we add it along with the `currentStep` and continue to the next generation.

4.  **Simulation Loop:**
    The main part of the code will set up the initial grid, add it to the history, and then enter a loop:
    1.  Increment `step` counter.
    2.  Generate the `nextGrid`.
    3.  Check for `Death`.
    4.  Check for `Still` or `Oscillator` using the `historyMap`.
    5.  If no end condition is met, update `currentGrid` to `nextGrid` and store `nextGrid` in the `historyMap`.
    The loop continues until an end condition is met.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Read Input:** Read `W` and `H`, then read `H` lines to construct the initial `boolean[][]` grid.
2.  **`serializeGrid(grid: boolean[][]): string`:** Converts the 2D boolean array to a string (e.g., `#` for true, ` ` for false, rows separated by newlines). This unique string acts as a key for our history map.
3.  **`countLiveNeighbors(grid: boolean[][], r: number, c: number, W: number, H: number): number`:** Iterates `dr` from -1 to 1 and `dc` from -1 to 1, calculating `nr = r + dr`, `nc = c + dc`. It skips the cell itself (`dr === 0 && dc === 0`) and checks if `(nr, nc)` is within grid bounds. If valid and `grid[nr][nc]` is true, it increments the count.
4.  **`getNextGeneration(currentGrid: boolean[][], W: number, H: number): boolean[][]`:**
    *   Initializes `nextGrid` with all `false` cells.
    *   Loops through `r` from 0 to `H-1` and `c` from 0 to `W-1`.
    *   For each cell `(r, c)`:
        *   Gets `isAlive = currentGrid[r][c]`.
        *   Calls `countLiveNeighbors` for `currentGrid[r][c]`.
        *   Applies the 4 rules of Conway's Game of Life to determine `nextGrid[r][c]`.
    *   Returns `nextGrid`.
5.  **`isGridEmpty(grid: boolean[][]): boolean`:** Iterates through the grid; returns `false` immediately if any live cell is found, otherwise returns `true`.
6.  **Main Logic:**
    *   Initialize `currentGrid` with the input.
    *   Initialize `historyMap = new Map<string, number>()`.
    *   `step = 0`.
    *   Add the initial `currentGrid` (serialized) to `historyMap` with `step = 0`.
    *   Start a `while (true)` loop:
        *   Increment `step`.
        *   Call `getNextGeneration` to get `nextGrid`.
        *   Serialize `nextGrid`.
        *   If `isGridEmpty(nextGrid)`: print "Death" and break.
        *   If `historyMap.has(serializedNextGrid)`:
            *   Calculate `period = step - historyMap.get(serializedNextGrid)!`.
            *   If `period === 1`: print "Still".
            *   Else: print `Oscillator ${period}`.
            *   Break.
        *   Update `currentGrid = nextGrid`.
        *   Add `serializedNextGrid` to `historyMap` with the current `step`.

This approach ensures correct simulation and efficient cycle detection.
