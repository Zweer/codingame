The problem asks us to find the longest "incrementing sequence" within a given list of `N` integers. An incrementing sequence means that each number `Ik` in the sequence must be `I(k-1) + 1`. The sequence must maintain the relative order of elements from the original list, but they don't need to be adjacent. If there are multiple sequences with the maximum length, we must choose the one with the lowest starting integer.

This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming combined with a hash map (or `Map` in TypeScript) to store and retrieve sequence information quickly.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize a `Map` called `sequenceInfo`. This map will store information about the longest incrementing sequence *ending* with a particular number.
        *   `Key`: The integer `X` that ends a sequence.
        *   `Value`: An object `{ length: number, start: number }`, where `length` is the length of the longest sequence ending with `X`, and `start` is the first number in that sequence.
    *   Initialize `maxLength = 0` to keep track of the maximum length found so far across all sequences.
    *   Initialize `bestStartNum = Infinity` to keep track of the starting number of the overall longest sequence. This is initialized to a large value to correctly handle the "lowest starting integer" tie-breaking rule.

2.  **Iterate through Input Numbers:**
    *   Process each `currentNum` in the input array `Ik` in its given order.
    *   For each `currentNum`, calculate `prevNum = currentNum - 1`.
    *   **Check for Extension:**
        *   Look up `prevNum` in the `sequenceInfo` map.
        *   If `sequenceInfo.has(prevNum)`: This means `currentNum` can potentially extend a sequence that ends with `prevNum`.
            *   Get the `length` and `start` from `sequenceInfo.get(prevNum)`.
            *   The `currentLength` for the sequence ending with `currentNum` will be `prevSeq.length + 1`.
            *   The `currentStart` for this sequence will be `prevSeq.start`.
        *   If `sequenceInfo.has(prevNum)` is `false`: This means `currentNum` cannot extend any existing sequence that ends with `prevNum`. Therefore, `currentNum` must start a new sequence of length 1.
            *   `currentLength = 1`.
            *   `currentStart = currentNum`.
    *   **Update `sequenceInfo` for `currentNum`:**
        *   Before setting the `currentNum`'s information in `sequenceInfo`, check if there's already an entry for `currentNum`.
        *   We want to store the best sequence ending at `currentNum`. "Best" means the longest, or if lengths are equal, the one with the lowest starting number.
        *   `const existingInfo = sequenceInfo.get(currentNum);`
        *   `if (!existingInfo || currentLength > existingInfo.length || (currentLength === existingInfo.length && currentStart < existingInfo.start))`:
            *   If `currentNum` is not yet in the map, or the newly calculated sequence is longer, or it's the same length but starts with a lower number, then update `sequenceInfo.set(currentNum, { length: currentLength, start: currentStart });`. This ensures we always store the optimal sequence ending at `currentNum`.
    *   **Update Overall Best Sequence:**
        *   Compare `currentLength` with `maxLength`.
        *   If `currentLength > maxLength`: This is a new longest sequence. Update `maxLength = currentLength` and `bestStartNum = currentStart`.
        *   Else if `currentLength === maxLength`: This sequence has the same maximum length. Apply the tie-breaking rule: if `currentStart < bestStartNum`, update `bestStartNum = currentStart`.

3.  **Reconstruct and Output:**
    *   After iterating through all numbers, `maxLength` will hold the maximum length of any incrementing sequence, and `bestStartNum` will hold its starting number (applying the tie-breaking rule).
    *   Construct the result array by adding `bestStartNum`, `bestStartNum + 1`, ..., up to `bestStartNum + maxLength - 1`.
    *   Print the numbers in the result array, separated by spaces.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where `N` is the number of integers. We iterate through the input array once. Each `Map` operation (`get`, `set`) takes O(1) on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N), in the worst case, if all numbers are distinct and form many short sequences, the `sequenceInfo` map could store up to `N` entries.

**Example Walkthrough (Input: `0 -1 1 2 4`)**

*   `N = 5`, `Ik = [0, -1, 1, 2, 4]`
*   `maxLength = 0`, `bestStartNum = Infinity`, `sequenceInfo = Map{}`

1.  `currentNum = 0`:
    *   `prevNum = -1`. `sequenceInfo` doesn't have `-1`.
    *   `currentLength = 1`, `currentStart = 0`.
    *   `sequenceInfo.set(0, {len: 1, start: 0})`.
    *   `maxLength = 1`, `bestStartNum = 0`.

2.  `currentNum = -1`:
    *   `prevNum = -2`. `sequenceInfo` doesn't have `-2`.
    *   `currentLength = 1`, `currentStart = -1`.
    *   `sequenceInfo.set(-1, {len: 1, start: -1})`.
    *   `currentLength (1) == maxLength (1)`. `currentStart (-1) < bestStartNum (0)`. Update `bestStartNum = -1`.
    *   Current best: length 1, starts at -1 (i.e., `[-1]`).

3.  `currentNum = 1`:
    *   `prevNum = 0`. `sequenceInfo.get(0)` is `{len: 1, start: 0}`.
    *   `currentLength = 1 + 1 = 2`. `currentStart = 0`.
    *   `sequenceInfo.set(1, {len: 2, start: 0})`.
    *   `currentLength (2) > maxLength (1)`. Update `maxLength = 2`, `bestStartNum = 0`.
    *   Current best: length 2, starts at 0 (i.e., `[0, 1]`).

4.  `currentNum = 2`:
    *   `prevNum = 1`. `sequenceInfo.get(1)` is `{len: 2, start: 0}`.
    *   `currentLength = 2 + 1 = 3`. `currentStart = 0`.
    *   `sequenceInfo.set(2, {len: 3, start: 0})`.
    *   `currentLength (3) > maxLength (2)`. Update `maxLength = 3`, `bestStartNum = 0`.
    *   Current best: length 3, starts at 0 (i.e., `[0, 1, 2]`).

5.  `currentNum = 4`:
    *   `prevNum = 3`. `sequenceInfo` doesn't have `3`.
    *   `currentLength = 1`, `currentStart = 4`.
    *   `sequenceInfo.set(4, {len: 1, start: 4})`.
    *   `currentLength (1) < maxLength (3)`. No update to overall best.

**Final Result:**
`maxLength = 3`, `bestStartNum = 0`.
Reconstruct: `[0, 0+1, 0+2]` which is `[0, 1, 2]`.
Output: `0 1 2`
