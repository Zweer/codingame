The problem asks us to find the shortest, safest path for the Fellowship of the Ring from a starting spot to an ending spot in a graph of interconnected locations, while avoiding Orcs.

**Problem Analysis:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The "spots" are nodes in a graph, and "possible paths" are bidirectional edges. We can represent this using an adjacency list (a `Map` where keys are spot indices and values are arrays of connected spot indices).
2.  **Shortest Path:** Since each move between connected spots takes 1 unit of time (implied by the "N moves" and "time taken by the fellowship is 1 UNIT" rule), this is an unweighted shortest path problem. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm for this.
3.  **Safety Constraint (Crucial):** This is the main complexity. If it takes `N` moves for the fellowship to reach a target spot, and the Euclidean distance from *any* Orc's starting position to that target spot is `P`, then the spot is unsafe if `P <= N`. This means Orcs move at a speed of 1 unit distance per 1 unit of fellowship move. The starting spot itself is considered safe at 0 moves unless an Orc is literally on it.
4.  **Distance Calculation:** Standard Euclidean distance `sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)`.

**Solution Approach (BFS with Safety Check):**

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `spotCoords`: An array of `{x, y}` objects to store the coordinates of each spot, indexed by their spot number.
    *   `orcCoords`: An array of `{x, y}` objects for Orc positions.
    *   `adj`: A `Map<number, number[]>` to store the adjacency list of the graph.
    *   `queue`: A standard BFS queue storing `QueueItem` objects. Each `QueueItem` will contain:
        *   `spot`: The current spot index.
        *   `moves`: The number of moves taken to reach this spot from the start.
        *   `path`: An array of spot indices representing the path taken so far.
    *   `minMovesToSpot`: An array `number[]` initialized with `Infinity` for all spots. `minMovesToSpot[i]` will store the minimum number of moves required to reach spot `i` safely. This serves two purposes:
        *   Prevents cycles in BFS.
        *   Ensures we only process the shortest path to any given spot, crucial for BFS and avoiding redundant work.

2.  **`calculateDistance(p1, p2)` Function:** A helper function to compute the Euclidean distance between two points.

3.  **`isSafe(targetSpotIndex, movesTaken)` Function:**
    *   Takes a `targetSpotIndex` and the `movesTaken` to reach it.
    *   Retrieves the coordinates of `targetSpotIndex`.
    *   Iterates through all `orcCoords`. For each Orc, it calculates the distance from the Orc to `targetSpotCoord`.
    *   If `distance <= movesTaken` for any Orc, the spot is unsafe, and the function returns `false`.
    *   If no Orc can reach or pass the spot, it returns `true`.
    *   Special consideration for `movesTaken = 0`: The `dist <= 0` condition correctly identifies if an Orc is *exactly* at the target spot.

4.  **BFS Algorithm:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Create the `queue` and add the `startSpot` with `0` moves and `[startSpot]` as its path.
        *   Set `minMovesToSpot[startSpot] = 0`.
        *   **Crucial initial safety check:** Before starting BFS, verify if the `startSpot` itself is safe (`isSafe(startSpot, 0)`). If not, it's `IMPOSSIBLE`.
    *   **Loop:** While the `queue` is not empty:
        *   Dequeue `(currentSpot, currentMoves, currentPath)`.
        *   **Optimization:** If `currentMoves > minMovesToSpot[currentSpot]`, it means we've already found a shorter path to `currentSpot` and processed it. Skip this redundant (suboptimal) entry.
        *   For each `neighbor` of `currentSpot`:
            *   Calculate `newMoves = currentMoves + 1`.
            *   **Shortest Path Check:** If `newMoves < minMovesToSpot[neighbor]` (meaning this is a shorter path to `neighbor` than previously discovered):
                *   **Safety Check:** Call `isSafe(neighbor, newMoves)`.
                *   If `true` (safe):
                    *   Update `minMovesToSpot[neighbor] = newMoves`.
                    *   Construct `newPath = [...currentPath, neighbor]`.
                    *   **Goal Check:** If `neighbor === endSpot`, we've found the shortest, safest path. Print `newPath.join(' ')` and terminate.
                    *   Enqueue `{ spot: neighbor, moves: newMoves, path: newPath }`.
    *   **No Path Found:** If the BFS loop finishes and `endSpot` was never reached, print "IMPOSSIBLE".

**Edge Cases:**
*   `startSpot === endSpot`: Handled by a special check at the beginning. If the spot is safe, the path is just `startSpot`.
*   No Orcs (`M=0`): `isSafe` will always return `true`, reducing it to a standard BFS.
*   Disconnected Graph: BFS naturally handles this by exhausting the queue without finding the `endSpot`.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Reading input: `O(N + M + L)`.
*   `calculateDistance`: `O(1)`.
*   `isSafe`: `O(M)` (iterates through all Orcs).
*   BFS: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices (`N`) and `E` is the number of edges (`L`). Each time an edge is traversed, `isSafe` is called.
*   Overall complexity: `O((V + E) * M)`. With `N, M, L <= 100`, this is approximately `(100 + 100^2) * 100 = (100 + 10000) * 100 = 10100 * 100 = 1,010,000` operations, which is well within typical time limits.
