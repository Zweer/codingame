The puzzle asks us to draw an ASCII art representation of an annulus (ring) or a disc in a rectangular area. The drawing is based on a supersampling technique to determine the "coverage" of the ring within each character cell. The coverage then maps to a specific ASCII character. A frame must be drawn around the entire output.

Here's a breakdown of the solution logic:

1.  **Input Parsing**: Read `width`, `height`, `cx`, `cy`, `ro`, `ri`, and `samples` from the single input line. Store `ro*ro` and `ri*ri` to avoid repeated calculations in the inner loops, as the ring condition uses squared radii. Pre-calculate `1.0 / samples` for efficiency in supersampling.

2.  **Coordinate System Transformation**: This is the most crucial part.
    *   The input `width` and `height` refer to the number of character cells in the drawing area.
    *   The coordinates `(0,0)` are at the top-left of this drawing area.
    *   The problem states: "each character in the rectangle... is assumed to be **half a unit wide** and **one unit tall**". This means a character cell at `(col, row)` in the character grid system (where `col` is the column index and `row` is the row index) corresponds to a rectangular region in the *world coordinate system* where `cx`, `cy`, `ro`, `ri` are defined.
    *   Specifically, a character at `(col, row)` covers the world region from `(col * 0.5, row * 1.0)` to `((col + 1) * 0.5, (row + 1) * 1.0)`.
    *   The supersampling points for character `(col, row)` are given as `(col + (i+0.5)/samples, row + (j+0.5)/samples)` in the *character grid system*. Let's call these `charGrid_sample_x` and `charGrid_sample_y`.
    *   To get the corresponding *world coordinates* (`world_x`, `world_y`), we apply the scaling:
        *   `world_x = charGrid_sample_x * 0.5`
        *   `world_y = charGrid_sample_y * 1.0` (or simply `charGrid_sample_y`)

3.  **Ring Check Function**: Create a helper function `isInsideRing(px, py)` that returns `true` if a given world point `(px, py)` is inside the ring, `false` otherwise. The condition is `ri^2 <= (px - cx)^2 + (py - cy)^2 <= ro^2`.

4.  **Character Mapping Function**: Create a helper function `getChar(coverage)` that takes a coverage value (0.0 to 1.0) and returns the appropriate ASCII character based on the provided percentage ranges. The ranges are inclusive for the lower bound and exclusive for the upper bound (e.g., `[0%, 10%)`). An `if-else if` ladder, ordered from highest coverage to lowest, correctly implements this.

5.  **Main Drawing Loop**:
    *   Initialize a 2D array (e.g., `charGrid`) to store the computed characters for each cell.
    *   Iterate through each character cell from `y = 0` to `height - 1` and `x = 0` to `width - 1`.
    *   For each cell:
        *   Initialize `pointsInsideRing = 0`.
        *   Loop `i` from `0` to `samples - 1` and `j` from `0` to `samples - 1` to generate all `samples * samples` supersampling points.
        *   For each `(i, j)` pair:
            *   Calculate `charGrid_sample_x` and `charGrid_sample_y`.
            *   Convert them to `world_x` and `world_y` using the scaling `* 0.5` for x and `* 1.0` for y.
            *   Call `isInsideRing(world_x, world_y)`. If true, increment `pointsInsideRing`.
        *   Calculate `coverage = pointsInsideRing / (samples * samples)`.
        *   Call `getChar(coverage)` to get the character for the current cell and store it in `charGrid`.

6.  **Output Printing**:
    *   Print the top frame: `+` followed by `width` hyphens (`-`), then another `+`.
    *   Loop `y` from `0` to `height - 1`: print `|`, then the joined string of characters from `charGrid[y]`, then another `|`.
    *   Print the bottom frame, identical to the top frame.

This approach correctly handles the coordinate system, the supersampling, and the character mapping, adhering to all puzzle constraints and requirements.
