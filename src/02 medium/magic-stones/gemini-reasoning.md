The problem asks us to minimize the number of magic stones by combining them. The rule for combination is: two stones of level `i` can be combined to form one stone of level `i+1`. This process is similar to carrying over in binary addition. For example, two level 1 stones become one level 2 stone, two level 2 stones become one level 3 stone, and so on.

To minimize the number of stones, we should perform as many combinations as possible. The key insight is that combining lower-level stones can create higher-level stones, which might then be combined further. This suggests a greedy approach: always combine the lowest-level stones first.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Count Frequencies:** Store the count of stones for each level. A `Map<number, number>` (level -> count) is suitable for this, as stone levels can be sparse (e.g., levels 1 and 1,000,000,000).
2.  **Process Levels in Order:** To process stones from the lowest level upwards, a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) is an ideal data structure. It allows efficiently retrieving the smallest level that still needs processing.
3.  **Simulation Loop:**
    *   Initialize the `Map` with the counts of all input stones.
    *   Add all unique initial stone levels to the Min-Heap. Use a `Set` to track which levels are currently in the heap to avoid adding duplicates.
    *   While the Min-Heap is not empty:
        *   Extract the smallest `currentLevel` from the Min-Heap. Remove it from the `Set` tracking levels in the heap.
        *   Get the `count` of stones at `currentLevel` from the `Map`.
        *   If `count` is less than 2, these stones cannot be combined (they are either an odd number of stones from a previous combination, or were already fully combined). Skip to the next level in the heap.
        *   If `count` is 2 or more:
            *   Calculate `numNewStones = floor(count / 2)`. These are the stones of level `currentLevel + 1` that will be formed.
            *   Calculate `remainingStones = count % 2`. These are the stones of `currentLevel` that cannot be combined.
            *   Update the `count` for `currentLevel` in the `Map` to `remainingStones`.
            *   Add `numNewStones` to the count of `nextLevel = currentLevel + 1` in the `Map`.
            *   If the `new count` for `nextLevel` is now 2 or more, and `nextLevel` is not already in the Min-Heap (checked using the `Set`), push `nextLevel` into the Min-Heap and add it to the `Set`. This ensures that newly formed combinable stones are considered for future combinations.
4.  **Final Count:** After the loop finishes (meaning no more combinations are possible), sum up all the remaining stone counts in the `Map`. This sum is the minimum number of stones.

**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   Reading input and populating the `Map` and initial Min-Heap: O(N log N) in the worst case (if all N stones have distinct levels, each pushing into the heap costs O(log M) where M is the heap size, max M is N).
    *   The main processing loop: In the worst case, each combination reduces the total number of stones by one. Since we start with N stones, there can be at most N-1 combinations. Each combination involves one `pop` from the heap and at most one `push` to the heap. Each heap operation takes O(log M) time, where M is the number of distinct levels currently in the heap. The maximum number of distinct levels M will be at most N (initial distinct levels) + `log2(N)` (maximum possible level increase from combinations). So, M is approximately `N + log N`. Given N < 1000, M is small (around 1000-1010). Thus, each heap operation is very fast (O(log 1000) ~ O(10)).
    *   Total time complexity: O(N log N).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M) where M is the maximum number of distinct levels observed (roughly N + log N). This is also small (around 1000 elements in the map and heap).

This approach handles large arbitrary stone level values efficiently because it only iterates through levels that actually contain stones, rather than iterating through a potentially vast range of empty levels.
