The puzzle asks us to simulate a "Gravity Centrifuge" to determine the total number of tumbles applied to a landscape, and then output the final state of the landscape. A tumble consists of a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation followed by gravity acting on the `#` bits. The challenge lies in the potentially very large number of tumbles, requiring cycle detection.

Let's break down the solution into its main components:

### 1. Calculating the Total Number of Tumbles

The "Gravity Centrifuge" uses two drives, A and B, each with a momentum. Initially, both have a momentum of `1`. The operation is governed by a bitstream provided in octal, read from the least significant bit (LSB) first.

*   **Octal to Binary Conversion:** The input `operation` string is in octal. Each octal digit needs to be converted to its 3-bit binary equivalent (e.g., `1` -> `001`, `7` -> `111`). The resulting binary string must then be processed from LSB to MSB, meaning we should reverse the binary string before iterating.
*   **Drive Simulation:**
    *   We maintain `momentumA`, `momentumB`, and `totalTumbles`. These values can grow very large, so `BigInt` must be used in TypeScript.
    *   A boolean `isDriveATurn` toggles between true and false to alternate control.
    *   For each bit in the (reversed) binary stream:
        *   If it's Drive A's turn:
            *   If the bit is `1`, `totalTumbles` increases by `momentumA`.
            *   `momentumB` increases by `momentumA` (Drive A accelerates Drive B).
        *   If it's Drive B's turn:
            *   If the bit is `1`, `totalTumbles` increases by `momentumB`.
            *   `momentumA` increases by `momentumB` (Drive B accelerates Drive A).
        *   Switch `isDriveATurn`.

### 2. Simulating Landscape Tumbling with Cycle Detection

The total number of tumbles (`totalTumbles`) can be astronomically large, making direct simulation impossible. However, the landscape state is finite. This is a classic cycle detection problem.

*   **State Representation:** A 2D array of characters (`string[][]`) is used for the map. To detect cycles, we need a unique string representation of the map (`serializeMap`) to use as a key in a `Map` (hash table).
*   **Tumble Operation:** A single "tumble" consists of two steps:
    1.  **Rotation:** `rotate90CounterClockwise(map, H, W)`: This function takes the current `map` (with dimensions `H` x `W`) and returns a new map rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The new map will have dimensions `W` x `H`. The transformation rule is `map[r][c]` moves to `newMap[W - 1 - c][r]`.
    2.  **Gravity:** `applyGravity(map, H, W)`: This function takes a map and reorganizes the `#` characters within each column so they fall to the bottom. For each column, it counts the `#`s and then rebuilds the column with `.` at the top and `#` at the bottom.
*   **Cycle Detection Logic:**
    1.  Initialize `mapHistory` (a `Map<string, bigint>`) to store `serialized_map_string -> tumble_count`.
    2.  Initialize `tumbleSequence` (a `string[][][]`) to store the actual `map` objects for each `tumble_count`. This allows us to retrieve any past state.
    3.  Loop `k` from `0n` up to `totalTumbles`:
        *   Serialize the `currentMap`.
        *   Check if `serializedMap` is already in `mapHistory`.
            *   If yes, a cycle is found. `firstOccurrenceTumble = mapHistory.get(serializedMap)!` and `cycleLength = k - firstOccurrenceTumble`.
            *   We can then calculate the effective `finalMapIndex = Number(firstOccurrenceTumble + (totalTumbles - firstOccurrenceTumble) % cycleLength)`. Break the loop.
        *   If no, add `serializedMap` to `mapHistory` with `k` as its value, and `deepCopyMap(currentMap)` to `tumbleSequence`.
        *   If `k` equals `totalTumbles`, it means we reached the target without a cycle, so `finalMapIndex = Number(k)`. Break the loop.
        *   Otherwise, perform one tumble operation (`rotate90CounterClockwise` then `applyGravity`) to compute the `currentMap` for the next iteration. Update `currentH` and `currentW` accordingly.

### 3. Outputting the Final Map

After determining `finalMapIndex` (which will be a `number` because the number of reachable distinct states and cycle lengths for maps up to 100x100 is typically small enough to fit within `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), retrieve `tumbleSequence[finalMapIndex]` and print it row by row.

The problem states:
*   "For an odd tumble count: `width` lines of `height` characters where the `#` are at the bottom."
*   "For an even tumble count: `height` lines of `width` characters."

This is naturally handled by the simulation because the dimensions (`H`, `W`) of `currentMap` automatically flip after each tumble due to the rotation, correctly determining the dimensions of the final output map.

### Example Walkthrough (for `N=1` as derived from example input `1` (octal)):

1.  **Initial Map (H=5, W=17):** Stored as `tumbleSequence[0]`.
2.  **Calculate Tumbles:** `totalTumbles` is calculated as `1n`.
3.  **Simulate Tumbles:**
    *   `k=0n`: `currentMap` is the initial map. It's stored in `mapHistory` and `tumbleSequence[0]`. Then `currentMap` is transformed to `M_1` (rotated and gravity applied). Dimensions become `H=17, W=5`.
    *   `k=1n`: `currentMap` is `M_1`. It's stored in `mapHistory` and `tumbleSequence[1]`. Since `k === totalTumbles`, `finalMapIndex` is set to `1`. Loop breaks.
4.  **Output:** `tumbleSequence[1]` is printed. This map has `17` lines and `5` columns, matching the "odd tumble count" rule.

This robust approach ensures correctness for both small and very large tumble counts within memory constraints.
