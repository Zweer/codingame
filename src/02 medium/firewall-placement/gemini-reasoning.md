The problem asks us to find the best location to place a single firewall in a network to minimize the number of nodes infected by a virus. The virus starts at a given `virusLocation` and can spread through any link. A firewall placed on a node prevents the virus from traversing that node. We cannot place the firewall on the `virusLocation` itself.

**Problem Analysis:**

1.  **Network Representation**: The network is an undirected graph. An adjacency list is a suitable data structure for representing it.
2.  **Virus Spread**: The virus spreads to all nodes reachable from `virusLocation` through paths that *do not* include the firewall node.
3.  **Goal**: Minimize infected nodes, which is equivalent to maximizing protected nodes.
4.  **Firewall Placement**: We must choose a single node (not the `virusLocation`) for the firewall.

**Approach:**

The core idea is to simulate placing a firewall at every possible valid node and then calculate the number of infected nodes for each scenario. We then choose the firewall location that results in the minimum number of infected nodes.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:

1.  **Read Input and Build Graph**:
    *   Read `numNodes`, `virusLocation`, and `numLinks`.
    *   Create an adjacency list (`adj`) to store the network connections. For each link `(i, j)`, add `j` to `adj[i]` and `i` to `adj[j]` since links are undirected.

2.  **Iterate Through Firewall Candidates**:
    *   Initialize `minInfectedNodes` to a very large value (e.g., `numNodes + 1`) and `optimalFirewallLocation` to -1.
    *   Loop through each node `f` from `0` to `numNodes - 1`. This `f` is our current candidate for the firewall location.
    *   **Skip Invalid Candidates**: If `f` is the same as `virusLocation`, skip this iteration because a firewall cannot be placed there.

3.  **Simulate Virus Spread with Firewall**:
    *   For each valid `firewallCandidate`:
        *   Initialize `infectedCount = 0`.
        *   Create a `visited` array (boolean array of size `numNodes`) and initialize all entries to `false`. This tracks nodes reachable by the virus for the current firewall.
        *   Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from `virusLocation`:
            *   Create a queue and add `virusLocation` to it. Mark `virusLocation` as visited and increment `infectedCount`.
            *   While the queue is not empty:
                *   Dequeue a `currentNode`.
                *   For each `neighbor` of `currentNode`:
                    *   **Firewall Check**: If `neighbor` is equal to `firewallCandidate`, then the virus cannot pass through this node. Skip this `neighbor`.
                    *   If `neighbor` has not been visited:
                        *   Mark `neighbor` as visited.
                        *   Increment `infectedCount`.
                        *   Enqueue `neighbor`.
        *   After the BFS completes, `infectedCount` will hold the number of nodes infected if the firewall is placed at `firewallCandidate`.

4.  **Update Optimal Solution**:
    *   Compare the current `infectedCount` with `minInfectedNodes`.
    *   If `infectedCount` is smaller than `minInfectedNodes`, update `minInfectedNodes` to `infectedCount` and `optimalFirewallLocation` to `firewallCandidate`.

5.  **Output Result**: After checking all possible firewall candidates, `optimalFirewallLocation` will hold the index of the node that minimizes virus spread. Print this value.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Building the graph: `O(N + M)` where N is `numNodes` and M is `numLinks`.
*   Iterating through firewall candidates: `O(N)` iterations.
*   Inside each iteration: BFS traversal is `O(N + M)`.
*   Total complexity: `O(N * (N + M))`.
Given `N <= 500` and `M <= 800`, `N * (N + M) = 500 * (500 + 800) = 500 * 1300 = 650,000` operations, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.

**Queue Optimization for BFS:**
To avoid the `O(N)` performance of `Array.prototype.shift()` in JavaScript, a common optimization for queues in competitive programming is to use two pointers (`head` and `tail` implicitly by `array.length`) with a standard array: `queue.push()` for enqueue and `queue[head++]` for dequeue.
