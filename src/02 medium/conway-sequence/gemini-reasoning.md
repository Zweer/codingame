The problem asks us to generate a specific line of the Conway sequence (also known as the "Look-and-Say" sequence). We are given an initial number `R` and a target line number `L`.

The sequence is generated by describing the previous line. For example, if a line is `1 1 1 2 2 1`:
- There are three `1`s.
- Then there are two `2`s.
- Then there is one `1`.
So the next line would be `3 1 2 2 1 1`.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Input Reading:** Read the initial number `R` and the target line `L`.
2.  **Initialization:** Start with an array `currentLine` containing just the initial number `R`.
3.  **Iteration:** Since we already have the first line, we need to generate `L - 1` more lines. We loop from `lineNum = 2` up to `L`.
4.  **Line Generation Logic:** Inside the loop, for each `currentLine`, we generate `nextLine`:
    *   Initialize an empty array `nextLine`.
    *   Use a pointer `i` to traverse `currentLine`.
    *   For each element `currentLine[i]`:
        *   Store `currentNumber = currentLine[i]`.
        *   Initialize a `count` to `0`.
        *   Use an inner pointer `j` starting from `i`. While `j` is within the bounds of `currentLine` and `currentLine[j]` is equal to `currentNumber`, increment `count` and `j`. This counts consecutive occurrences of `currentNumber`.
        *   After the inner loop, `count` holds the number of consecutive `currentNumber`s found. Add `count` then `currentNumber` to `nextLine`.
        *   Update the main pointer `i` to `j` to continue processing the `currentLine` from the next distinct number.
    *   After iterating through the entire `currentLine`, `nextLine` will be fully formed. Assign `currentLine = nextLine` to prepare for the next iteration.
5.  **Output:** Once the loop finishes, `currentLine` will contain the elements of the `L`-th line. Join these elements with a space and print the resulting string.

**Constraints Analysis:**
-   `R` is between 1 and 99. This means `R` can be a single or two-digit number. The problem implies `R` is treated as a single numeric entity in the sequence (e.g., if `R=11`, the sequence starts `[11]`, then `[1, 11]`, not `[1, 1]` then `[2, 1]`).
-   `L` is up to 25. The length of the sequence grows exponentially, but for `L=25`, the line length will be manageable (a few hundred numbers), so this iterative approach is efficient enough.
