The problem asks us to find the maximum total value that can be obtained by cutting a rod of a given length `L` into pieces. We are provided with a list of marketable pieces, each with a specific length and an associated value. We can use any marketable piece multiple times. Pieces that are not marketable (or remainders after cutting) have a value of 0.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem, closely related to the unbounded knapsack problem or coin change problem (for maximum value).

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Define the DP State:**
    Let `dp[i]` be the maximum value that can be obtained from a rod of length `i`.

2.  **Base Case:**
    `dp[0] = 0`. A rod of length 0 has no value.

3.  **Initialization:**
    Initialize all elements of the `dp` array (from `dp[1]` to `dp[L]`) to `0`. This is important because if a specific length `i` cannot be formed by any combination of marketable pieces, its value correctly defaults to `0`.

4.  **Recursive Relation (Iteration):**
    To calculate `dp[currentLength]` for `currentLength` from 1 to `L`:
    For each `currentLength`, we iterate through all available `marketablePieces`.
    If a `piece` has `piece.length` and `piece.value`:
    *   If `currentLength` is greater than or equal to `piece.length` (meaning the piece can fit into the `currentLength` rod):
        *   We can potentially use this `piece`. If we use it, the remaining rod length would be `currentLength - piece.length`, and its maximum value is `dp[currentLength - piece.length]`.
        *   So, a candidate value for `dp[currentLength]` by using this `piece` would be `piece.value + dp[currentLength - piece.length]`.
        *   We take the maximum of the current `dp[currentLength]` (which might have been set by a previous `piece` or is still `0`) and this new candidate value:
            `dp[currentLength] = Math.max(dp[currentLength], piece.value + dp[currentLength - piece.length])`.

5.  **Filtering Marketable Pieces:**
    An important constraint is that marketable piece lengths can be very large (up to 10,000,000,000), while the total rod length `L` is at most 100,000. Any marketable piece with a `length` greater than `L` cannot possibly be used. Therefore, we should filter these out at the beginning to optimize the inner loop of our DP.

6.  **Final Result:**
    After iterating through all `currentLength` from 1 to `L`, `dp[L]` will contain the maximum total value that can be obtained from the original rod of length `L`.

**Example Walkthrough (L=4, pieces: (1,1), (2,5), (3,8), (4,9)):**

Initialize `dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (for lengths 0 to 4)

*   **`currentLength = 1`:**
    *   Consider piece (1,1): `dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], 1 + dp[1-1]) = Math.max(0, 1 + dp[0]) = 1`.
    `dp` becomes `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`

*   **`currentLength = 2`:**
    *   Consider piece (1,1): `dp[2] = Math.max(dp[2], 1 + dp[2-1]) = Math.max(0, 1 + dp[1]) = 2`.
    *   Consider piece (2,5): `dp[2] = Math.max(dp[2], 5 + dp[2-2]) = Math.max(2, 5 + dp[0]) = 5`.
    `dp` becomes `[0, 1, 5, 0, 0]`

*   **`currentLength = 3`:**
    *   Consider piece (1,1): `dp[3] = Math.max(dp[3], 1 + dp[3-1]) = Math.max(0, 1 + dp[2]) = 6`.
    *   Consider piece (2,5): `dp[3] = Math.max(dp[3], 5 + dp[3-2]) = Math.max(6, 5 + dp[1]) = 6`.
    *   Consider piece (3,8): `dp[3] = Math.max(dp[3], 8 + dp[3-3]) = Math.max(6, 8 + dp[0]) = 8`.
    `dp` becomes `[0, 1, 5, 8, 0]`

*   **`currentLength = 4`:**
    *   Consider piece (1,1): `dp[4] = Math.max(dp[4], 1 + dp[4-1]) = Math.max(0, 1 + dp[3]) = 9`.
    *   Consider piece (2,5): `dp[4] = Math.max(dp[4], 5 + dp[4-2]) = Math.max(9, 5 + dp[2]) = 10`.
    *   Consider piece (3,8): `dp[4] = Math.max(dp[4], 8 + dp[4-3]) = Math.max(10, 8 + dp[1]) = 10`.
    *   Consider piece (4,9): `dp[4] = Math.max(dp[4], 9 + dp[4-4]) = Math.max(10, 9 + dp[0]) = 10`.
    `dp` becomes `[0, 1, 5, 8, 10]`

The final answer is `dp[4] = 10`.

**Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(L * N_effective)`, where `N_effective` is the number of marketable pieces whose length is less than or equal to `L`. In the worst case, `N_effective` is equal to `N`. Given `L <= 100,000` and `N < 50`, the maximum operations are roughly `100,000 * 49 = 4.9 million`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(L)` for the `dp` array. With `L <= 100,000`, this is `100,000 * sizeof(number)`, which is well within typical memory limits.
