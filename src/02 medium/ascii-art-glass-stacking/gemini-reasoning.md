The puzzle asks us to construct an ASCII art pyramid of glasses given a number `N`. First, we need to determine the largest possible pyramid that can be built with `N` glasses. Then, we render this pyramid using a predefined ASCII art pattern for a single glass.

**1. Determine Pyramid Height (maxR):**
A pyramid with `R` rows has `1 + 2 + ... + R` glasses. This sum can be calculated using the formula `R * (R + 1) / 2`. We iterate `R` starting from 1, calculating the required glasses, until `glassesRequired > N`. The `maxR` will be the last `R` for which `glassesRequired <= N`.

**2. Analyze Glass ASCII Art and Dimensions:**
The problem provides a basic glass representation:
```
 ***
 * *
 * *
*****
```
However, the example output suggests that each glass occupies a consistent block, padded with spaces for centering within a row and spacing between glasses. By analyzing the example for `N=4`:
```
       ***       (Top glass, width 7)
       * *
       * *
      *****
    ***   ***    (Bottom row, 2 glasses)
    * *   * *
    * *   * *
   ***** *****
```
-   The base of the single glass `*****` appears to be padded to a width of 7 (e.g., ` ***** `).
-   The top part ` ***` also appears to be padded to a width of 7 (e.g., `  ***  `).
-   Glasses in a row are separated by 1 space.
-   The height of a single glass block is 4 lines.

Based on this, we define the `GLASS_LINES` as a 7-character wide string for each of the 4 lines.
-   `GLASS_HEIGHT = 4`
-   `GLASS_WIDTH_EFFECTIVE = 7` (The block size a single glass occupies for layout)
-   `GLASS_SPACING = 1` (Space between `GLASS_WIDTH_EFFECTIVE` blocks)

**3. Calculate Total Grid Dimensions:**
-   **Total Height:** `maxR * GLASS_HEIGHT`
-   **Base Width:** The bottom-most row of the pyramid has `maxR` glasses. Its width will be `maxR * GLASS_WIDTH_EFFECTIVE + (maxR - 1) * GLASS_SPACING`. (If `maxR` is 0 or 1, handle the `(maxR - 1)` part correctly, `(1-1)*1 = 0`, so it works).

**4. Populate the Output Grid:**
We create a 2D grid (represented as an array of strings in TypeScript, where each string is a row of the ASCII art), initialized with spaces.
Then, we iterate through each `pyramidRow` from `0` to `maxR - 1` (top to bottom):
-   For each `pyramidRow`, determine the `numGlassesInCurrentRow` (which is `pyramidRow + 1`).
-   Calculate `currentRowWidth` for centering.
-   Calculate `x_offset`: `(baseWidth - currentRowWidth) / 2` to center the current row horizontally.
-   Calculate `y_offset`: `pyramidRow * GLASS_HEIGHT` for the vertical placement of the row.
-   Inside this loop, iterate for each `glassIndex` in the `currentPyramidRow`:
    -   Calculate `currentGlassX`, the absolute starting x-position for this specific glass.
    -   Copy the `GLASS_LINES` pattern into the `outputGrid` at the calculated `(targetY, currentGlassX)` positions. String manipulation is done by converting the line to a character array, modifying it, and joining it back.

**5. Print Output:**
Finally, join all the strings in the `outputGrid` array with newline characters to produce the complete ASCII art.

**Example for N=4:**
1.  **maxR calculation:**
    -   R=1: 1 glass. `1 <= 4`. `maxR = 1`.
    -   R=2: 3 glasses. `3 <= 4`. `maxR = 2`.
    -   R=3: 6 glasses. `6 > 4`. Stop.
    So, `maxR = 2`.

2.  **Dimensions:**
    -   `totalHeight = 2 * 4 = 8`.
    -   `baseWidth = 2 * 7 + (2 - 1) * 1 = 14 + 1 = 15`.
    `outputGrid` initialized as 8 lines of 15 spaces.

3.  **Populating (simplified):**
    -   **Pyramid Row 0 (1 glass):**
        -   `numGlassesInCurrentRow = 1`. `currentRowWidth = 7`.
        -   `x_offset = (15 - 7) / 2 = 4`. `y_offset = 0`.
        -   Place `GLASS_LINES` at `(0, 4)`.
    -   **Pyramid Row 1 (2 glasses):**
        -   `numGlassesInCurrentRow = 2`. `currentRowWidth = 15`.
        -   `x_offset = (15 - 15) / 2 = 0`. `y_offset = 4`.
        -   Place `GLASS_LINES` at `(4, 0)` and `(4, 0 + 7 + 1 = 8)`.

This logic correctly reproduces the example output.
