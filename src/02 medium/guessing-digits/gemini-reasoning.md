The problem asks us to simulate a guessing game between three students, Maggie, Burt, and Sarah, to determine two digits, `a` and `b`, between 1 and 9 (inclusive). Maggie picks the digits, gives their sum `s` to Burt, and their product `p` to Sarah. The game proceeds in rounds: Maggie first asks Burt if he knows the digits, then if he doesn't, she asks Sarah. If Sarah doesn't know, they repeat the sequence (Burt, then Sarah) until one of them correctly guesses the digits. We need to output the digits, the name of the first person to guess them, and the number of rounds. If they can never guess the digits, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

**Core Idea**

The problem is a classic logic puzzle that requires simulating the players' reasoning. Each player deduces information not only from their own secret number (`s` for Burt, `p` for Sarah) but also from the other player's declaration of "I don't know." When a player says "I don't know," it means that, given the current public knowledge, their secret number is consistent with *multiple* possible pairs `(a,b)`. This declaration updates the public knowledge by eliminating any `(a,b)` pairs that *would* have allowed the player to know at that specific moment.

**Detailed Breakdown and Algorithm**

1.  **Generate All Possible Pairs:**
    Since `a` and `b` are between 1 and 9, we can precompute all possible unique pairs `(a,b)` where `1 <= a <= b <= 9`. For each pair, we store its sum and product. We use a canonical representation (e.g., `(1,2)` instead of `(2,1)`) to simplify the set of possibilities. This results in 45 unique pairs.

2.  **Represent Public Knowledge:**
    We maintain a `Set` called `currentKnowledge` which stores string representations of the `(a,b)` pairs (e.g., `'1,2'`) that are still considered possible by both players at any given point. Initially, `currentKnowledge` contains all 45 precomputed pairs.

3.  **Simulate Rounds:**
    The game proceeds in a loop, counting rounds. In each round:

    *   **Burt's Turn:**
        *   Burt considers his secret sum `S`. He looks at all pairs `(x,y)` in the `currentKnowledge` set. If there is only one such pair `(x,y)` whose sum is `S`, Burt knows the digits. The game ends, and we output `(x,y) BURT <rounds>`.
        *   If Burt does *not* know (i.e., there are multiple pairs in `currentKnowledge` that sum to `S`), his declaration "I don't know" provides new information. We update `currentKnowledge`: for every `(x,y)` in the *current* `currentKnowledge` set, we determine if Burt *would have known* that `(x,y)` was the true pair if `x+y` were his secret sum. If Burt *would have known* this pair (meaning `(x,y)` is the unique pair in `currentKnowledge` for sum `x+y`), then `(x,y)` cannot be the true pair (because Burt just said he *doesn't* know). Such `(x,y)` pairs are removed from `currentKnowledge`. Only pairs that Burt *would not* have known (meaning there were multiple possibilities for their sum) are kept.

    *   **Check for Impossible / Stalled State (After Burt):**
        *   If `currentKnowledge` becomes empty, it means no valid pairs remain, so the digits are "IMPOSSIBLE" to guess.
        *   If `currentKnowledge` size remains unchanged after Burt's update, it means Burt's "I don't know" statement provided no new information. This indicates a stalled state. If this happens for both players in a round, it leads to an infinite loop, so it's "IMPOSSIBLE."

    *   **Sarah's Turn:**
        *   Sarah considers her secret product `P`. She looks at all pairs `(x,y)` in the *updated* `currentKnowledge` set. If there is only one such pair `(x,y)` whose product is `P`, Sarah knows the digits. The game ends, and we output `(x,y) SARAH <rounds>`.
        *   If Sarah does *not* know (i.e., multiple pairs in `currentKnowledge` have product `P`), her declaration also provides new information. We update `currentKnowledge` using the same logic as for Burt, but based on products instead of sums. Pairs `(x,y)` are removed if Sarah *would have known* them based on their product `x*y` being unique in the current `currentKnowledge` set.

    *   **Check for Impossible / Stalled State (After Sarah):**
        *   Similar checks as after Burt's turn. If `currentKnowledge` is empty or its size remains unchanged, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

**Implementation Details:**

*   `formatPair(a, b)`: Converts `[a,b]` into a string `a,b` ensuring `a <= b` for canonical representation (e.g., `(1,2)`).
*   `parsePair(s)`: Converts the string `a,b` back to `[a,b]`.
*   `wouldPlayerKnow(secretKey, secretValue, knownPairsAsStrings)`: A helper function that takes a secret value (`S` or `P`) and the current set of `knownPairsAsStrings`. It counts how many pairs in `knownPairsAsStrings` match the `secretValue`. If the count is 1, the player `would know`.
*   `filterKnowledgeAfterPlayerSaysIDontKnow(knownPairsAsStrings, playerRole)`: This is the core logic for updating `currentKnowledge`. It iterates through each `testPair` in `knownPairsAsStrings`. For each `testPair`, it determines what `testSecretValue` (sum or product) it would have. Then, it calls `wouldPlayerKnow` to see if the player *would have known* `testPair` if `testSecretValue` was the actual secret. If `wouldPlayerKnow` returns `true` (meaning the `testPair` is unique for its `testSecretValue` within `knownPairsAsStrings`), it means this `testPair` cannot be the actual pair (because the player just said "I don't know"). So, such `testPair`s are *excluded* from the `nextKnowledge` set.

The loop continues until one player knows the digits or an "IMPOSSIBLE" state is reached.
