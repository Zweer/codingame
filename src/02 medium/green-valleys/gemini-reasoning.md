The problem asks us to find the deepest point within the largest "green valley" on a given square map. A "green valley" consists of connected green tiles, where a tile is green if its height is at or below a specified snow line `H`. Connectivity is defined by horizontal or vertical adjacency. If multiple valleys share the largest size, we should choose the one with the overall deepest point (lowest height). If no valleys exist, the output should be 0.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1.  **Parse Input**: Read the snow line height `H`, the map size `N`, and then the `N x N` grid of tile heights. Store the map in a 2D array.

2.  **Initialize Tracking Variables**:
    *   `maxValleySize`: To keep track of the largest valley area found so far. Initialize to 0.
    *   `deepestPointOverall`: To store the deepest point corresponding to `maxValleySize`. Initialize to 0 (this handles the "no valleys" case).
    *   `visited`: A 2D boolean array of the same size as the map, initialized to `false`. This will help us track which green tiles have already been assigned to a valley, preventing re-processing and ensuring correct valley delimitation.

3.  **Iterate and Discover Valleys**:
    *   Loop through each cell `(r, c)` of the map.
    *   For each cell, check two conditions:
        *   Is the tile green? (i.e., `heightMap[r][c] <= H`)
        *   Has it been visited already? (`!visited[r][c]`)
    *   If both conditions are true, it means we've found an unvisited green tile that is part of a new, undiscovered valley. Initiate a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) from this tile to find all connected green tiles belonging to this valley.

4.  **BFS/DFS for Valley Properties**:
    *   When starting a new BFS/DFS, initialize `currentValleySize = 0` and `currentValleyDeepestPoint = Infinity` (since tile heights are positive, `Infinity` guarantees the first height will be lower).
    *   Add the starting tile `(r, c)` to a queue (for BFS) or stack (for DFS) and mark it as `visited[r][c] = true`.
    *   While the queue/stack is not empty:
        *   Dequeue/pop a tile `(currR, currC)`.
        *   Increment `currentValleySize`.
        *   Update `currentValleyDeepestPoint = Math.min(currentValleyDeepestPoint, heightMap[currR][currC])`.
        *   Explore its four neighbors (up, down, left, right):
            *   For each neighbor `(nextR, nextC)`, check if it's within map bounds.
            *   If it's in bounds, green (`heightMap[nextR][nextC] <= H`), and not yet visited (`!visited[nextR][nextC]`), mark it as visited and add it to the queue/stack.

5.  **Compare and Update Largest Valley**:
    *   Once the BFS/DFS for a valley completes, `currentValleySize` and `currentValleyDeepestPoint` will hold the properties of that specific valley.
    *   Compare `currentValleySize` with `maxValleySize`:
        *   If `currentValleySize > maxValleySize`: This new valley is the largest found so far. Update `maxValleySize = currentValleySize` and `deepestPointOverall = currentValleyDeepestPoint`.
        *   If `currentValleySize === maxValleySize`: This valley has the same size as the current largest. According to the problem, we must pick the one with the *overall deepest point*. So, update `deepestPointOverall = Math.min(deepestPointOverall, currentValleyDeepestPoint)`.

6.  **Output Result**: After iterating through all cells, `deepestPointOverall` will contain the required answer. If no valleys were found (meaning `maxValleySize` remained 0), `deepestPointOverall` will correctly be 0.

The largest connected component of green tiles is formed by cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). This valley has 9 tiles. The heights of these tiles are: 2, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 4, 4, 2. The minimum height among these is 2.
There's another small valley at (4,4) with height 5. Its size is 1, deepest point 5.
Since the first valley (size 9, deepest point 2) is larger, the answer is 2.
