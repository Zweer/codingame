## Reasoning

The problem asks us to simulate the spread of a disease among porcupines in a farm over a given number of years. Porcupines are kept in cages, and the disease mechanics apply per cage.

Here's a breakdown of the rules and how they are applied each year:

1.  **State Representation:** For each cage, we need to track two numbers: the count of `sick` porcupines (`S`) and the count of `healthy` porcupines (`H`). The total alive porcupines in a cage is simply `S + H`.

2.  **Yearly Simulation Logic (for each cage):**
    Let `S_prev` be the number of sick porcupines at the *beginning* of the current year, and `H_prev` be the number of healthy porcupines at the *beginning* of the current year.

    *   **Infection:** Each of the `S_prev` sick porcupines will cause 2 healthy porcupines in the same cage to become sick. The total number of potential new infections is `S_prev * 2`. However, we cannot infect more porcupines than are currently healthy. So, the actual number of `newlySick` porcupines is `min(S_prev * 2, H_prev)`.
    *   **Healthy Update:** The number of healthy porcupines remaining in the cage after infections is `H_current = H_prev - newlySick`.
    *   **Sick Porcupines Die:** The `S_prev` porcupines (who were sick at the start of the year) die *after* causing infections. This means they are removed from the population count. The porcupines who will be sick for the *next* year are precisely the `newlySick` ones from this year. So, `S_current = newlySick`.
    *   **Total Alive in Cage:** The total number of porcupines alive in this cage at the *end* of the current year (and for the start of the next year) will be `H_current + S_current`.

3.  **Overall Simulation Flow:**
    *   Read the initial `N` (number of cages) and `Y` (number of years).
    *   Read the initial `S` and `H` for each of the `N` cages and store them (e.g., in an array of objects).
    *   Loop `Y` times, representing each year:
        *   Initialize a `totalAliveThisYear` counter to 0.
        *   Create a temporary array (`nextCages`) to store the state of all cages *after* the current year's events. This is crucial to ensure that all calculations for a given year are based on the state at the *beginning* of that year, without interference from changes in other cages or the same cage within the same year.
        *   Iterate through each cage: apply the infection, healthy update, and sick death rules as described above to calculate the `H_current` and `S_current` for that cage. Add `H_current + S_current` to `totalAliveThisYear`. Store `{sick: S_current, healthy: H_current}` in `nextCages`.
        *   After processing all cages for the year, replace the main `cages` array with the contents of `nextCages`.
        *   Print `totalAliveThisYear`.
        *   **Stop Condition:** If `totalAliveThisYear` becomes 0, print "0" (only once if it's the first time it reaches zero) and then stop the simulation (break the year loop).

4.  **Constraints and Data Types:**
    *   `N` (up to 499) and `Y` (up to 99) are small, so the simulation will be very fast.
    *   `S` and `H` can be up to 10,000,000. The total alive across all cages could be `500 * 10,000,000 = 5 * 10^9`. JavaScript's `number` type (which uses 64-bit floating-point) can accurately represent integers up to `2^53 - 1` (approx `9 * 10^15`), so there will be no overflow issues.

This logic ensures that the simulation accurately follows the rules, handles edge cases (like no healthy porcupines, no sick porcupines, or all porcupines dying), and performs efficiently within the given constraints.
