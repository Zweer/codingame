The puzzle requires minifying a CGS (CodinGame Script) by:
1.  Removing all whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) except for characters strictly inside string literals (between apostrophes).
2.  Combining all lines into a single output line.
3.  Minifying variable names, which are enclosed in dollar signs (e.g., `$hello$`). The first unique variable found is replaced by `$a$`, the second by `$b$`, and so on.

Given the constraints (`N < 10` and fewer than 10 variables), a two-pass approach is efficient enough:

**Phase 1: Whitespace Removal and Line Concatenation**
We read all input lines and concatenate them into a single string. Then, we iterate through this combined string character by character. We use a boolean flag, `inQuote`, to track whether we are currently inside a string literal.
*   If we encounter an apostrophe (`'`), we toggle the `inQuote` flag and append the apostrophe to our result.
*   If `inQuote` is true, we append the character directly to our result, preserving any whitespace within the string literal.
*   If `inQuote` is false (meaning we are outside a string literal), we only append the character if it is *not* a space, tab, newline, or carriage return. This effectively removes all unnecessary whitespace while preserving string literal content.

**Phase 2: Variable Minification**
After the first phase, we have a single line of CGS content with all non-quoted whitespace removed. Now, we need to minify the variables.
We use a `Map` to store the mapping from original variable names (e.g., `"hello"`) to their minified counterparts (e.g., `"a"`). We also maintain a character code counter, starting from `'a'`, to generate sequential minified names.
We use the `String.prototype.replace()` method with a regular expression `/\$([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\$/g`. This regex finds all occurrences of variable names enclosed in dollar signs and captures the name itself (without the dollars). The `g` flag ensures all occurrences are matched.
In the replacement callback function:
*   We check if the extracted `varName` (e.g., `"hello"`) is already in our `Map`.
*   If it's a new variable, we generate the next available minified name (`a`, then `b`, etc.), store it in the map, and increment our character counter.
*   We then return the minified variable name enclosed in dollar signs (e.g., `$a$`).

This two-phase approach correctly handles all the specified rules and provides the minified output on a single line.
