The problem asks us to simulate a paper-writing process and report the number of papers remaining each day. We are given a `seed`, `N` (number of `papers`), and `power`.

Here's a breakdown of the solution approach:

1.  **Generate Initial Page Counts**:
    *   The page counts for `N` papers are generated using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG): `Z(n+1) = (1664525 * Z(n) + 1013904223) MOD (2 ^ Power)`.
    *   `Z(0)` is the given `seed`. The values for the papers are `Z(1), Z(2), ..., Z(N)`.
    *   The constraint `N < 10^8` means we cannot store all `N` page counts in a simple array due to memory limits.
    *   However, the `power` constraint `1 < power < 8` means `2^Power` is small (max `2^7 = 128`). This implies page counts are always between `0` and `127`.
    *   This observation suggests using a **frequency array** (or hash map) to store the counts of papers for each possible page value. `freq[i]` will store how many papers have `i` pages left. The size of this array will be `2^Power`.

2.  **Simulate Daily Work**:
    *   The simulation proceeds day by day until all papers have 0 pages left.
    *   In each "day":
        *   **Find the lowest positive page count**: Iterate through the `freq` array from index 1 upwards to find the smallest `minPages` for which `freq[minPages] > 0`. Papers with 0 pages are ignored for this step as per the rule "Ignore the ones who have 0 pages left for the next turn".
        *   **Subtract `minPages`**: For every page count `i` where `freq[i] > 0`, all `freq[i]` papers have their page count reduced by `minPages`. This means papers with `i` pages now have `i - minPages` pages.
        *   **Update `freq` array**: To accurately reflect the new state, we create a `nextFreq` array. For each `i` from `minPages` up to `maxMod - 1` (where `maxMod = 2^Power`), if `freq[i] > 0`, we add `freq[i]` papers to `nextFreq[i - minPages]`.
        *   **Calculate `papersCurrentlyActive`**: After updating the `freq` array (by copying `nextFreq` to `freq`), we recount the number of papers that still have positive pages left. This sum (`freq[1] + freq[2] + ... + freq[maxMod-1]`) becomes `papersCurrentlyActive` for the start of the *next* day.
        *   **Record `papersCurrentlyActive`**: This count is added to our `resultCounts` array.
    *   The loop continues as long as `papersCurrentlyActive` is greater than 0.

**Example Trace (as per problem statement):**
Initial pages: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6]`
`freq = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]` (index: count -> 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 6:1)
`papersCurrentlyActive` (initially) = 5 (total papers, excluding any initial 0s)

**Day 1:**
*   `minPages = 1` (from `freq[1]`).
*   Subtract 1 from all: `[1, 0, 3, 2, 5]` (conceptually).
*   `nextFreq` generation:
    *   Papers with 1 page become 0: `nextFreq[0] += 1`
    *   Papers with 2 pages become 1: `nextFreq[1] += 1`
    *   Papers with 3 pages become 2: `nextFreq[2] += 1`
    *   Papers with 4 pages become 3: `nextFreq[3] += 1`
    *   Papers with 6 pages become 5: `nextFreq[5] += 1`
*   `freq` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`.
*   `papersCurrentlyActive` (for Day 2 start) = `freq[1]+freq[2]+freq[3]+freq[5] = 1+1+1+1 = 4`.
*   `resultCounts.push(4)`.

**Day 2:**
*   `minPages = 1` (from `freq[1]`).
*   Subtract 1 from all: `[0, 2, 1, 4]` (conceptually, after removing the 0 from previous day).
*   `nextFreq` generation:
    *   Papers with 1 page become 0: `nextFreq[0] += 1`
    *   Papers with 2 pages become 1: `nextFreq[1] += 1`
    *   Papers with 3 pages become 2: `nextFreq[2] += 1`
    *   Papers with 5 pages become 4: `nextFreq[4] += 1`
*   `freq` becomes `[2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   `papersCurrentlyActive` (for Day 3 start) = `freq[1]+freq[2]+freq[4] = 1+1+1 = 3`.
*   `resultCounts.push(3)`.

This process continues, matching the example output `4 3 2 1 0`.

The time complexity is `O(N + (2^Power)^3)`. `N` for LCG generation and `(2^Power)^3` for simulation (number of days * freq array size * freq array size). Given `N < 10^8` and `Power < 8`, this is `10^8 + (128)^3`, which is efficient enough.
