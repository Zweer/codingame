The puzzle asks us to reconstruct a 3D model from three 2D orthogonal projections: a front view (X-Z plane), a right-side view (Y-Z plane), and a top view (X-Y plane). We need to print the model layer by layer from bottom to top, where each layer is a 2D slice showing the projection of that layer.

**1. Coordinate System Definition:**
Let's define a 3D coordinate system for our model:
*   `X`: Width dimension, from `0` (left) to `width-1` (right).
*   `Y`: Length dimension, from `0` (front) to `length-1` (back).
*   `Z`: Height dimension, from `0` (bottom) to `height-1` (top).

**2. Input Interpretation and Mapping to 3D Coordinates:**

*   **`frontView` (width x height):** This view is taken along the Y-axis. The input `frontView[i][x]` corresponds to a character at `x` in the width and `i` in the height. Since `frontView[0]` is the top line of the view and `model[0]` is the bottom layer, a transformation is needed for the Z-coordinate. `frontView[height - 1 - z]` corresponds to the `z`-th layer of our 3D model.
*   **`rightView` (length x height):** This view is taken along the X-axis. The input `rightView[i][y]` corresponds to a character at `y` in the length and `i` in the height. Similar to `frontView`, `rightView[height - 1 - z]` corresponds to the `z`-th layer of our 3D model.
*   **`topView` (width x length):** This view is taken along the Z-axis. The input `topView[y][x]` corresponds directly to the `(x, y)` coordinates on the top plane. No Z-transformation is needed here, as `y` in `topView` directly corresponds to our `y` coordinate.

**3. Building the 3D Model (`model[z][y][x]`):**

The crucial rule is: "If the three pictures cannot define some parts of the model as solid or hollow, assume these parts are solid, so that output '#' to fill-in."

This means a voxel at `(x, y, z)` is solid (`#`) if and only if it could exist without violating any of the given views. In other words:
*   The corresponding cell in the `frontView` (at `X=x` and `Z=z`) must be '#'. If `frontView[height - 1 - z][x]` is '.', it implies nothing at `(x, ?, z)` can be solid, including `(x, y, z)`.
*   The corresponding cell in the `rightView` (at `Y=y` and `Z=z`) must be '#'. If `rightView[height - 1 - z][y]` is '.', it implies nothing at `(?, y, z)` can be solid, including `(x, y, z)`.
*   The corresponding cell in the `topView` (at `X=x` and `Y=y`) must be '#'. If `topView[y][x]` is '.', it implies nothing at `(x, y, ?)` can be solid, including `(x, y, z)`.

Therefore, a voxel `model[z][y][x]` is solid (`#`) if and only if ALL three corresponding view characters are '#'. If any of them is '.', the voxel `model[z][y][x]` must be hollow ('.').

The algorithm for building the model is:
1.  Initialize a 3D array `model[height][length][width]` with all elements as hollow ('.').
2.  Iterate through all possible `(x, y, z)` coordinates for the 3D model.
3.  For each `(x, y, z)`, check the characters from `frontView`, `rightView`, and `topView` at their respective corresponding positions.
4.  If all three characters are '#', set `model[z][y][x]` to '#'.

**4. Generating the Output:**

The output format is layers from bottom to top, separated by `--`. The example output `##` for a `2x5x1` block indicates that each layer is printed as a single line of `width` characters. This implies that for a given `z` layer, the character at `x` in the output line is '#' if *any* voxel `model[z][y][x]` across all `y` (depth) values is '#'. If all `model[z][y][x]` for a given `(x, z)` are '.', then the output character is '.'.

The algorithm for generating output:
1.  Initialize an empty list of strings for output lines.
2.  Iterate `z` from `0` to `height-1` (bottom to top layers).
3.  For each `z`, create an empty string `currentLayerLine`.
4.  Iterate `x` from `0` to `width-1`.
5.  For each `(x, z)` pair, check if `model[z][y][x]` is '#' for *any* `y` from `0` to `length-1`.
6.  If a solid voxel is found for this `(x, z)` column, append '#' to `currentLayerLine`; otherwise, append '.'.
7.  After iterating through all `x` for the current `z`, add `currentLayerLine` to the output lines list.
8.  Add the separator `--` to the output lines list.
9.  Finally, print all lines in the output list joined by newline characters.

**Example Walkthrough (2x5x1 Block):**

*   `width=2, height=5, length=1`
*   `frontView`: 5 lines of "##"
*   `rightView`: 5 lines of "#"
*   `topView`: 1 line of "##"

1.  **Build Model:**
    *   Initialize `model[5][1][2]` with all '.'.
    *   For every `(x, y, z)` (where `y` must be 0 because `length=1`):
        *   `frontChar` will always be '#' (`frontView[height-1-z][x]`).
        *   `rightChar` will always be '#' (`rightView[height-1-z][y]`).
        *   `topChar` will always be '#' (`topView[y][x]`).
    *   Since all view characters are '#', every `model[z][0][x]` will become '#'. The entire 3D block is solid.

2.  **Generate Output:**
    *   For `z=0` to `4` (bottom to top):
        *   `currentLayerLine = ""`
        *   For `x=0`: `model[z][0][0]` is '#'. `currentLayerLine` becomes "#".
        *   For `x=1`: `model[z][0][1]` is '#'. `currentLayerLine` becomes "##".
        *   Add "##" to output, then add "--".
    *   This results in 5 pairs of "##" and "--", which matches the example output.

This logic correctly handles the "assume solid" rule and the output format.
