The problem asks us to find the maximum total prize money Merry and Pippin can win from `N` tournaments, given that they can play at most `R` consecutive tournaments before needing a rest.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. We need to keep track of two types of states for each day `i`:
1.  The maximum prize money if Merry and Pippin **rested** on day `i`.
2.  The maximum prize money if Merry and Pippin **played** on day `i`, and day `i` was part of a streak of `k` consecutive playing days.

Let's define our DP states:

*   `dp_play[k]`: The maximum prize money earned up to the *current day*, where the current day was played and it was the `(k+1)`-th consecutive day in a playing streak. `k` ranges from `0` to `R-1` (meaning `1` to `R` consecutive days).
*   `dp_rest`: The maximum prize money earned up to the *current day*, where the current day was a rest day.

We will iterate through the tournaments day by day. Since the current day's calculations only depend on the previous day's states, we can optimize space by only storing the `prev` and `current` states instead of an `N x R` and `N` table.

Let's use `prev_dp_play`, `current_dp_play` arrays (of size `R`) and `prev_dp_rest`, `current_dp_rest` variables.

**Initialization (Day 0, i.e., `prizes[0]`):**

*   `prev_dp_play[0] = prizes[0]`: If we play on day 0, it's the first day of a streak.
*   `prev_dp_play[k] = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` for `k > 0`: Cannot have played more than 1 day consecutively on day 0.
*   `prev_dp_rest = 0`: If we don't play on day 0 (effectively resting), the money earned is 0. This also serves as a base for starting any streak.

**Iteration (for `i` from 1 to `N-1`):**

For each day `i`, we calculate `current_dp_rest` and `current_dp_play` based on `prev_dp_rest` and `prev_dp_play`.

1.  **Calculate `current_dp_rest` (resting on day `i`):**
    If Merry and Pippin rest on day `i`, they gain no money from `prizes[i]`. Their total money would be the maximum money they had accumulated by day `i-1`. This could be either from resting on day `i-1` or from playing on day `i-1` (any valid streak length).
    `current_dp_rest = Math.max(prev_dp_rest, ...prev_dp_play)`

2.  **Calculate `current_dp_play[k]` (playing on day `i`):**
    *   **Case `k=0` (Day `i` is the 1st consecutive day played):**
        To start a new streak on day `i`, Merry and Pippin must have rested on day `i-1`.
        `current_dp_play[0] = prizes[i] + prev_dp_rest`

    *   **Case `k > 0` (Day `i` is the `(k+1)`-th consecutive day played):**
        To continue a streak, Merry and Pippin must have played on day `i-1` as the `k`-th consecutive day.
        `current_dp_play[k] = prizes[i] + prev_dp_play[k-1]`
        We must ensure `prev_dp_play[k-1]` was a valid (reachable) state (not `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`).

3.  **Update for next iteration:**
    After calculating all `current_dp_rest` and `current_dp_play` for day `i`, these become the `prev` values for day `i+1`.
    `prev_dp_rest = current_dp_rest`
    `prev_dp_play = [...current_dp_play]` (a deep copy is necessary to avoid reference issues)

**Final Result:**

After iterating through all `N` days, the maximum prize money will be the maximum of all possible states on the last day (`N-1`). This includes the money from resting on the last day (`prev_dp_rest`) or playing a streak ending on the last day (any value in `prev_dp_play`).
`max_money = Math.max(prev_dp_rest, ...prev_dp_play)`

**Example walkthrough (N=10, R=4, P=[13, 2, 15, 17, 19, 33, 2, 2, 2, 2])**

This logic correctly produces the example output of `103`.

**Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(N * R)` - We iterate `N` times, and in each iteration, we perform `O(R)` operations (max over `R` elements, and `R` updates to `dp_play`).
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(R)` - We only store arrays/variables proportional to `R`.
