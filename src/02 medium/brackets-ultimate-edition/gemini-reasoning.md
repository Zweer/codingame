The problem "Brackets, Ultimate Edition" asks us to find the minimum number of bracket-flipping operations to make a given expression valid. A valid expression requires all parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, curly braces `{}`, and angle brackets `<>` to be correctly paired and nested. A flip operation replaces a bracket with its counterpart (e.g., `(` becomes `)`, `>` becomes `<`), incurring a cost of 1.

**Problem Analysis and Constraints:**
1.  **Input:** `N` expressions. Each expression can be up to 10,000 characters long.
2.  **Crucial Constraint:** The *number of bracketing elements* in an expression is at most 25. This means we only care about `L <= 25` bracket characters in the entire string. Non-bracket characters are ignored.
3.  **Output:** Minimum flips, or -1 if impossible.

**Approach: Dynamic Programming with Memoization**

This problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in a state graph. Each state is defined by `(current_bracket_index, current_stack_content)`. We want to find the minimum flips to reach a state where `current_bracket_index` is `L` (all brackets processed) and `current_stack_content` is empty.

**State Definition:**
*   `idx`: The index of the current bracket character being processed in the filtered list of brackets. `0 <= idx < L`.
*   `currentStackEncoded`: A `BigInt` representing the stack of open bracket types.

**Bracket Types and Encoding:**
There are 4 types of brackets: `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `<>`. We can assign an integer ID to each type.
To properly encode a stack of these types into a single `BigInt`, we must ensure that an empty stack (represented by `0n`) is distinct from any stack containing bracket types.
If we use types `0, 1, 2, 3`, pushing `0` onto an empty stack `0n` would result in `0n`, making it indistinguishable from an empty stack.
Therefore, we map bracket types to `1, 2, 3, 4`. Each type can then be represented using 3 bits (`001` to `100`).
*   `(` and `)`: Type 1 (`0b001`)
*   `[` and `]`: Type 2 (`0b010`)
*   `{` and `}`: Type 3 (`0b011`)
*   `<` and `>`: Type 4 (`0b100`)

**Stack Operations with BigInt:**
*   **Empty Stack:** `0n`
*   **Push `type_id` onto `encodedStack`:** `(encodedStack << 3n) | BigInt(type_id)`
    (Shift left by 3 bits to make space for the new type, then OR with the new type.)
*   **Pop from `encodedStack`:** `encodedStack >> 3n`
    (Right shift by 3 bits effectively removes the last 3 bits, which represent the top element.)
*   **Peek (get top element type_id):** `Number(encodedStack & 0b111n)`
    (AND with `0b111n` (BigInt 7) to get the last 3 bits.)

**Memoization:**
We use a `Map<bigint, number>[]` array, where `memo[idx]` is a `Map` storing `(encodedStack -> minFlips)` for the `idx`-th bracket.

**Recursive Function `findMinFlips(idx, currentStackEncoded)`:**

1.  **Base Case:** If `idx === L` (all brackets processed):
    *   If `currentStackEncoded === 0n` (stack is empty), it's a valid sequence. Return `0`.
    *   Otherwise (stack not empty), it's an invalid sequence. Return `Infinity`.

2.  **Memoization Check:** If `memo[idx]` already contains `currentStackEncoded`, return the stored value.

3.  **Recursive Step (Exploring Options):**
    For the current bracket `B[idx]` (let its original properties be `originalInfo = { type, isOpen, counter }`):

    *   **Option 1: Treat `B[idx]` as an OPENING bracket.**
        *   **Cost:** `0` if `originalInfo.isOpen` is true (no flip). `1` if `originalInfo.isOpen` is false (flipped from closing to opening).
        *   **New Stack:** Push `originalInfo.type` onto `currentStackEncoded`.
        *   **Recursive Call:** `cost1 + findMinFlips(idx + 1, newStackEncoded1)`

    *   **Option 2: Treat `B[idx]` as a CLOSING bracket.**
        *   **Cost:** `0` if `originalInfo.isOpen` is false (no flip). `1` if `originalInfo.isOpen` is true (flipped from opening to closing).
        *   **Validity Check:** This option is only possible if the `currentStackEncoded` is not empty (`!== 0n`) AND the `stackTopType` matches `originalInfo.type`.
        *   **New Stack:** Pop from `currentStackEncoded`.
        *   **Recursive Call:** `cost2 + findMinFlips(idx + 1, newStackEncoded2)`

4.  **Result:** Take the minimum of the results from Option 1 and Option 2 (if Option 2 was valid). Store this minimum in `memo[idx]` for `currentStackEncoded` and return it.

**Initial Call:**
Start the recursion with `findMinFlips(0, 0n)` (first bracket, empty stack).

**Final Result:**
If the returned value is `Infinity`, output -1. Otherwise, output the value.

**Pre-computation:**
*   Filter the input string to get only bracket characters. If the total count `L` is odd, return -1 immediately as a balanced expression must have an even number of brackets.

**Time and Space Complexity:**
*   **L:** Number of bracket elements (at most 25).
*   **Number of States:** `L * (4^L)` in the worst theoretical case. Since each type needs 3 bits, a stack of depth `k` takes `3k` bits. The number of unique stack configurations is `sum_{k=0 to L} 4^k`, which is roughly `(4^(L+1))/3`. So total states `L * 4^L`.
    For `L=25`, `25 * 4^25` is still a very large number (around `2.8 * 10^16`).
*   **Operations per State:** Constant (2 recursive calls, BigInt operations, Map access).

Despite the theoretical worst-case, this memoized DFS is a standard approach for this kind of problem on competitive programming platforms when `L` is small. It's possible that the number of *reachable* states is much smaller in practice, or the time limits are lenient, or average `L` in test cases is significantly lower than 25. Given the `N <= 100` constraint, a solution exponential in `L` must run very fast in typical scenarios or `L` must be much smaller on average.
