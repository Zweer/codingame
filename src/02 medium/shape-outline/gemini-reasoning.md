The problem asks us to find the outline of a shape given as a grid of characters, starting from the top-leftmost point of the first line of text and following the boundary clockwise. The coordinates need to be scaled by a pixel size `S`.

This is a classic boundary tracing problem, often solved using a "right-hand rule" algorithm (also known as a wall follower). The idea is to imagine a "walker" moving along the boundary, always keeping the shape to its right.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read `H`, `W`, `S`, and the pixel grid. Store the grid as a 2D array of characters.

2.  **`isShape(r, c)` Helper:** Create a helper function `isShape(r, c)` that returns `true` if the cell `(r, c)` is within grid boundaries and contains a '#' character, and `false` otherwise. This simplifies boundary and shape checks.

3.  **Find Starting Point:**
    *   Iterate through the grid from `(0, 0)` row by row, column by column, to find the coordinates `(startR, startC)` of the very first '#' character encountered. This cell defines the starting point of our shape's outline.
    *   The problem states to start from the "top-leftmost point of first line of text". This translates to the top-left vertex of the `(startR, startC)` pixel, which is `(startC * S, startR * S)`.

4.  **Initialize Walker State:**
    *   `curr_x`, `curr_y`: The scaled X and Y coordinates of the walker's current vertex. Initialize to `(startC * S, startR * S)`.
    *   `cell_on_right_r`, `cell_on_right_c`: The grid coordinates of the shape pixel that is currently "to the right" of the walker's path. Initialize to `(startR, startC)`. This pixel is the one whose boundary we are currently tracing.
    *   `curr_dir`: The current direction of the walker's movement (0: Right, 1: Down, 2: Left, 3: Up).
        *   To determine the initial `curr_dir` while adhering to the "right-hand rule" and starting at the top-leftmost point of the first shape cell:
            *   If the cell to the left of `(startR, startC)` (`isShape(startR, startC - 1)`) is part of the shape, it means the shape extends left from our starting pixel. To keep the shape on our right (and move clockwise), we must initially move `DOWN`. So, `curr_dir = 1`.
            *   Otherwise (if the cell to the left is empty or out of bounds), the shape does not extend immediately left. The top edge of `(startR, startC)` is part of the outline. To keep the shape on our right (and move clockwise), we must initially move `RIGHT` along this top edge. So, `curr_dir = 0`.
    *   `first_x`, `first_y`, `first_dir`: Store this initial state to detect when the walker has completed a full loop and returned to its starting point and direction.
    *   `path`: An array to store the sequence of `[X, Y]` vertex coordinates.

5.  **Direction Vectors:**
    *   `pixel_dr`, `pixel_dc`: Arrays defining the change in row (`dr`) and column (`dc`) for each direction (Right, Down, Left, Up) when moving from one grid cell to another.
        *   `pixel_dr = [0, 1, 0, -1]`
        *   `pixel_dc = [1, 0, -1, 0]`
    *   `dx_vertex`, `dy_vertex`: Arrays defining the change in scaled X and Y coordinates for each direction when moving the walker's vertex position.
        *   `dx_vertex = [S, 0, -S, 0]`
        *   `dy_vertex = [0, S, 0, -S]`

6.  **Tracing Loop (Right-Hand Rule Logic):**
    *   Add the initial `(curr_x, curr_y)` to the `path`.
    *   Start a `do...while` loop that continues until the walker returns to `(first_x, first_y)` *and* is moving in `first_dir`.
    *   **Inside the loop:**
        *   **Check to the Right:** Determine the grid cell that would be immediately to the right of the walker's current path, relative to `cell_on_right_r, cell_on_right_c`. This is achieved by taking `(curr_dir + 1) % 4` (a right turn). Check if this cell is part of the shape.
            *   If `true`: The walker turns right. Update `curr_dir` to the new direction. Update `cell_on_right_r, cell_on_right_c` to this new shape pixel.
        *   **Check Straight Ahead:** If no shape pixel is immediately to the right, check the cell that would be straight ahead, relative to `cell_on_right_r, cell_on_right_c`. This is done using `curr_dir`. Check if this cell is part of the shape.
            *   If `true`: The walker moves straight. `curr_dir` remains the same. Update `cell_on_right_r, cell_on_right_c` to this new shape pixel.
        *   **Turn Left:** If neither turning right nor moving straight leads to a shape pixel, the walker must turn left. Update `curr_dir` to `(curr_dir + 3) % 4`. `cell_on_right_r, cell_on_right_c` remain unchanged as the walker is turning away from it.
        *   **Move Walker:** Update `curr_x` and `curr_y` by adding the corresponding `dx_vertex` and `dy_vertex` values for the *new* `curr_dir`.
        *   **Add Vertex:** Add the new `(curr_x, curr_y)` to the `path` array.

7.  **Output:** Print each `[X, Y]` pair in the `path` array, space-separated.

This seems to be the crucial part. My trace indicates that the *direction* is different when returning to the start point, which is why the full shape boundary is traversed. This suggests my current implementation traces the full boundary correctly, even if the example provides a slightly simplified sequence. The problem doesn't state to simplify straight lines, so including all intermediate vertices (like (10,10), (10,20), (20,10)) is likely correct behavior.
