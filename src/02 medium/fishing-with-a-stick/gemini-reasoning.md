The problem asks us to simulate a fishing scenario on a grid and count the total number of fish caught. The grid contains various elements: water, fish, fishing rod segments, hooks, and garbage. The simulation proceeds in turns, where entities move and interact according to specific rules.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Grid Representation:**
    The water area is represented by a `H`x`W` grid. Each cell stores a character indicating its content. We'll use a `string[][]` for this.

2.  **Rod Identification:**
    The fishing rod is a static structure. Its definition is crucial:
    *   Any `|` character is part of the rod.
    *   A `C` character is part of the rod if:
        *   It's directly below another rod segment (either a `|` or a `C` that is itself part of the rod).
        *   **Special case:** If there are *no* `|` characters anywhere in the entire grid, then the *first* (leftmost) `C` in the first row (`H=0`) becomes the anchor of the rod. Any `C` characters directly below this anchor in the same column also become part of the rod. Otherwise, any `C` is considered garbage.

    To implement this, we'll use a `boolean[][]` called `isRod` to mark all cells that belong to the fishing rod.
    *   First, iterate through the grid and mark all `|` characters in `isRod`. Keep a flag `hasAnyPipe` to track if any `|` was found.
    *   If `!hasAnyPipe`: Find the leftmost `C` in row 0. If found, mark it and all consecutive `C`s below it in the same column as `isRod`.
    *   If `hasAnyPipe`: Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or a similar propagation method. Start with all `|` cells in a queue. For each cell popped from the queue, if the cell directly below it is a `C` and not yet marked as `isRod`, mark it as `isRod` and add it to the queue. This ensures all `C`s that are part of the rod (i.e., extensions of `|` segments) are identified.

3.  **Simulation Loop:**
    The simulation proceeds turn by turn until a termination condition is met.
    *   **Termination Conditions:**
        *   The fishing rod breaks (due to touching garbage).
        *   No more moving entities (fish or garbage) are left on the grid, or the grid state stops changing (implying all active entities have disappeared or are stuck in a way that implies disappearance).

    **Inside each turn:**
    a.  **Initialize `nextGrid`:** Create a new `string[][]` for the next turn's state. All cells are initially `.` (water). Static rod segments are copied from `currentGrid` to `nextGrid`.
    b.  **Plan Movements:** Iterate through the `currentGrid`.
        *   For each fish (`<` or `>`): Determine its next horizontal position. If it moves out of bounds, it disappears. Otherwise, add it to a `collisionMap` for its target cell.
        *   For each garbage (any non-rod, non-water, non-fish character, including 'C's not part of the rod): Determine its next horizontal position based on `currentD`. If it moves out of bounds, it disappears. Otherwise, add it to the `collisionMap` for its target cell.
        *   The `collisionMap` uses cell coordinates (e.g., "row,col") as keys, and its value is an object containing arrays of `fishes` and `garbages` attempting to move into that cell.
    c.  **Resolve Collisions and Update `nextGrid`:** Iterate through all cells `(r, c)`:
        *   Retrieve the list of `fishes` and `garbages` targeting this cell from the `collisionMap`.
        *   **If `(r, c)` is a rod segment (`isRod[r][c]` is true):**
            *   If any `garbages` touched it, the `rodBroken` flag becomes `true`.
            *   If any `fishes` touched it, increment `fishCaught` by the number of fish.
            *   The rod segment itself remains in `nextGrid[r][c]`. All entities that touched it disappear.
        *   **If `(r, c)` is NOT a rod segment:**
            *   If both `fishes` and `garbages` are present: Both disappear. `nextGrid[r][c]` remains `.`.
            *   If multiple `fishes` are present: All disappear. `nextGrid[r][c]` remains `.`.
            *   If exactly one `fish` is present: The fish moves to this cell. `nextGrid[r][c]` becomes the fish character.
            *   If one or more `garbages` are present (and no fish): One garbage character occupies the cell. `nextGrid[r][c]` becomes a garbage character (arbitrarily pick one if multiple).
            *   Otherwise (no entities or resolved collisions resulting in disappearance): `nextGrid[r][c]` remains `.`.
    d.  **Update Grid and Check Termination:**
        *   Set `currentGrid = nextGrid`.
        *   Compare `currentGrid` with its state at the beginning of the turn. If no character has changed position (or disappeared/appeared), set `gridChanged = false`.
        *   If `rodBroken` is `true`, or if `gridChanged` is `false` (meaning the simulation has stabilized), break the loop.

4.  **Output:**
    Print the final `fishCaught` count.

This detailed simulation ensures all rules, including simultaneous movements and specific collision outcomes, are handled correctly.
