The Killer Sudoku puzzle extends the classic Sudoku rules with an additional constraint: "cages". A cage is a group of cells, whose values must sum to a specified total, and numbers within a cage cannot repeat.

Here's a breakdown of the rules and how the solution addresses them:
1.  **Row Constraint:** Each row must contain digits 1-9 exactly once.
2.  **Column Constraint:** Each column must contain digits 1-9 exactly once.
3.  **3x3 Region Constraint:** Each 3x3 subgrid (region) must contain digits 1-9 exactly once.
4.  **Cage Constraint:**
    *   The sum of values in cells belonging to a cage must equal the cage's target sum.
    *   Numbers within a cage cannot repeat.

**Approach: Backtracking Algorithm**

This problem is a classic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) best solved with a backtracking algorithm. The core idea is:

1.  **Find an empty cell:** Locate the next unassigned cell on the board.
2.  **Try possible values:** For each digit from 1 to 9, check if placing it in the current cell violates any of the rules.
3.  **Validate and recurse:** If a digit is valid, place it, update the game state (including cage-specific information), and recursively call the solver for the next empty cell.
4.  **Backtrack:** If the recursive call returns `false` (meaning no solution was found down that path), undo the placement and try the next digit. If all digits have been tried and failed, return `false`.
5.  **Solution found:** If no empty cells are left, a valid solution has been found, return `true`.

**Data Structures:**

*   `grid: number[][]`: A 9x9 2D array representing the Sudoku board. `0` indicates an empty cell.
*   `cages: Map<string, CageInfo>`: A map where keys are cage IDs (e.g., 'a', 'B') and values are `CageInfo` objects.
*   `cellToCageId: string[][]`: A 9x9 2D array to quickly find the `cageId` for any given `(row, col)` cell.

**`CageInfo` Interface:**

To efficiently manage cage constraints during backtracking, each `CageInfo` object stores:
*   `id`: The character identifier of the cage.
*   `sum`: The target sum for the cage.
*   `cells: CellCoords[]`: A list of `(row, col)` coordinates for all cells in this cage.
*   `currentSum: number`: The sum of values currently placed in this cage (dynamically updated).
*   `valuesUsed: Set<number>`: A set of numbers currently present in this cage (for fast repetition checks, dynamically updated).
*   `emptyCount: number`: The number of empty cells remaining in this cage (dynamically updated).

**Key Functions:**

1.  **`canPlace(r: number, c: number, val: number): boolean`**:
    This function checks if `val` can be placed at `(r, c)` without violating any rules *before* actually placing it.
    *   **Standard Sudoku Checks:** It iterates through the row, column, and 3x3 block to ensure `val` is not already present.
    *   **Cage Repetition Check:** It checks if `val` is already in the `valuesUsed` set of the cell's corresponding cage.
    *   **Cage Sum Check (Pruning):**
        *   It verifies that `cage.currentSum + val` does not exceed `cage.sum`. If it does, `val` is invalid for this cell, as it would make the cage sum impossible.
        *   **Crucial Optimization:** If placing `val` fills the *last empty cell* in the cage (`cage.emptyCount === 1`), it then strictly checks if `cage.currentSum + val` *exactly* equals `cage.sum`. If not, this path is invalid. This helps prune the search space significantly.

2.  **`solve(): boolean`**:
    This is the recursive backtracking function.
    *   It finds the next empty cell (iterating through `grid` from `(0,0)` to `(8,8)`).
    *   If no empty cells, it returns `true` (solution found).
    *   For each possible `val` (1-9):
        *   If `canPlace(r, c, val)` is true:
            *   Place `val` in `grid[r][c]`.
            *   **Update Cage State:** Increment `cage.currentSum`, add `val` to `cage.valuesUsed`, and decrement `cage.emptyCount`.
            *   Recursively call `solve()`.
            *   If `solve()` returns `true`, propagate `true` up the call stack.
            *   **Backtrack & Revert Cage State:** If the recursive call returns `false`, reset `grid[r][c]` to `0`, decrement `cage.currentSum`, remove `val` from `cage.valuesUsed`, and increment `cage.emptyCount`.
    *   If no `val` works for the current cell, return `false`.

**Initialization:**

1.  The first 9 input lines are parsed to populate the initial `grid` (with `.` converted to `0`), `cellToCageId`, and to build the initial `cages` map (populating `id` and `cells` for each cage).
2.  The 10th input line provides the target sums for each cage, which are then assigned to the respective `CageInfo` objects in the `cages` map.
3.  Finally, the dynamic state (`currentSum`, `valuesUsed`, `emptyCount`) for each cage is initialized based on any pre-filled numbers in the input `grid`.

**Example:**
The provided example input and output are correctly handled by this logic. The problem states "Each test case has only one solution," which simplifies things as we don't need to find multiple solutions or complex heuristics like MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) for performance, though the current pruning is already quite effective.
