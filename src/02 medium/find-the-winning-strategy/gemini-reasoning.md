The problem describes an impartial game played on a grid, which is a classic scenario for applying the Sprague-Grundy theorem. The hint explicitly points to this theorem, confirming this approach.

**Understanding the Game and Applying Sprague-Grundy Theorem**

1.  **Impartial Game:** The game is impartial because the available moves from any state depend only on the state itself, not on whose turn it is. This is a key characteristic for applying the Sprague-Grundy theorem.

2.  **Game State per Row:** Consider a single row. We have "your" token at `xPlayer` and the "boss's" token at `xBoss`. We are given `xPlayer < xBoss`.
    *   Your token can move right (towards `xBoss`).
    *   The boss's token can move left (towards `xPlayer`).
    *   Neither token can go beyond the other.
    *   If `xBoss - xPlayer = 1` (tokens are side-by-side), no moves are possible for that row.

    The critical observation is that the actual positions `xPlayer` and `xBoss` don't matter as much as the *distance* or *space* between them. The number of empty cells between `xPlayer` and `xBoss` is `d = xBoss - xPlayer - 1`.

3.  **Moves and Grundy Values:**
    *   When `d = 0`, the tokens are side-by-side, and no moves are possible. This is a losing position for the current player. By definition, its Grundy value `G(0) = 0`.
    *   If you move your token from `xPlayer` to `newX`, the new distance becomes `xBoss - newX - 1`. Since `newX` must be between `xPlayer` and `xBoss` (i.e., `xPlayer < newX < xBoss`), any such move reduces the distance `d`. Specifically, `newX` can be any position from `xPlayer + 1` to `xBoss - 1`. This allows the new distance `d'` to be any value from `0` to `d - 1`.
    *   The same logic applies if the boss moves their token: they can also reduce the distance `d` to any `d'` where `0 <= d' < d`.

    A game state where you can move to any state with a smaller non-negative Grundy value is equivalent to a Nim pile. The Grundy value `G(d)` for such a state `d` is `d` itself.
    *   `G(0) = mex({}) = 0`
    *   `G(1) = mex({G(0)}) = mex({0}) = 1`
    *   `G(2) = mex({G(0), G(1)}) = mex({0, 1}) = 2`
    *   And so on, `G(d) = d`.

4.  **Overall Game (Sum of Games):** The entire game is a sum of independent games, one for each row. According to the Sprague-Grundy theorem, the Grundy value of a sum of games is the XOR sum of the Grundy values of the individual games.
    So, the total Grundy value (or Nim-sum) for the entire grid is `Nim_sum = G(d_0) XOR G(d_1) XOR ... XOR G(d_rows-1)`.
    Since `G(d_i) = d_i`, this simplifies to `Nim_sum = d_0 XOR d_1 XOR ... XOR d_rows-1`.

5.  **Winning Strategy:**
    *   A position is a winning position (N-position) if its Nim-sum is non-zero.
    *   A position is a losing position (P-position) if its Nim-sum is zero.
    *   We are guaranteed to start on a winning position, meaning `Nim_sum` will be non-zero at the beginning of our turn.
    *   To win, we must make a move that transforms the current N-position into a P-position. This means, after our move, the new Nim-sum must be `0`.

    Let `N` be the current `Nim_sum`. We need to pick a row `i` and move our token on that row such that its Grundy value `d_i` changes to `d_i'`, and the new total Nim-sum is `0`.
    The new Nim-sum would be `N XOR d_i XOR d_i'`. We want this to be `0`.
    Therefore, `d_i' = N XOR d_i`.

    We must find a row `i` such that we can change its `d_i` to `target_d = N XOR d_i`. A move is only valid if it reduces the Grundy value, so we must have `target_d < d_i`.
    It is a property of the Nim-sum that if `N` is non-zero, there will always be at least one row `i` where `target_d < d_i` is true.

    Once we find such a row `i` and `target_d`, we need to calculate the new position for our token (`newX`) on that row.
    The new distance is `target_d = xBoss_i - newX - 1`.
    Solving for `newX`: `newX = xBoss_i - target_d - 1`.
    This `newX` will always be valid:
    *   `newX > xPlayer_i`: because `target_d < d_i`.
    *   `newX < xBoss_i`: because `target_d >= 0`.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Read `rows` and `columns`.
2.  Start a game loop:
    a.  Initialize `nimSum = 0`.
    b.  Create an array to store `(xPlayer, xBoss, d)` for each row.
    c.  For each row `i` from `0` to `rows - 1`:
        i.  Read `xPlayer` and `xBoss` for the current row.
        ii. Calculate `d_i = xBoss - xPlayer - 1`.
        iii. Add `d_i` to the `nimSum` using XOR: `nimSum ^= d_i`.
        iv. Store `xPlayer`, `xBoss`, and `d_i` for later use.
    d.  Initialize `bestRow = -1` and `bestNewX = -1`.
    e.  Iterate through each row `i` from `0` to `rows - 1`:
        i.  Retrieve `xPlayer_i`, `xBoss_i`, and `d_i` for this row.
        ii. Calculate `target_d = nimSum ^ d_i`.
        iii. If `target_d < d_i` (meaning a valid move exists on this row to achieve `target_d`):
            1.  Calculate `newX = xBoss_i - target_d - 1`.
            2.  Set `bestRow = i` and `bestNewX = newX`.
            3.  Break the loop (as the first valid winning move found is sufficient).
    f.  Output `bestRow bestNewX`.

**Constraints Check:**
*   `rows` (up to 40) and `columns` (up to 35) are small.
*   The maximum `d` value would be `columns - 2 = 33`.
*   The Nim-sum calculation involves simple XOR operations on small integers, and finding the move is `O(rows)`.
*   This approach is extremely efficient and will easily meet the 50ms time limit per turn.
