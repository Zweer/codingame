The problem asks us to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of a given string `s`. A subsequence is formed by deleting zero or more characters from the original string without changing the order of the remaining characters. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. The key insight is that the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) of a string `s` is equivalent to the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between `s` and its reverse, `reverse(s)`.

Let's briefly explain why:
1.  **If `P` is an LPS of `s`**: Since `P` is a subsequence of `s` and `P` is a palindrome, `P` is also a subsequence of `reverse(s)` (because `reverse(P)` is `P`, and `P` being a subsequence of `s` implies `reverse(P)` is a subsequence of `reverse(s)`). Thus, `P` is a common subsequence of `s` and `reverse(s)`.
2.  **If `C` is an LCS of `s` and `reverse(s)`**: Let `C = c_1 c_2 ... c_k`. Since `C` is a common subsequence, `c_1` must correspond to some character `s[i]` and `reverse(s)[j]`. Similarly, `c_k` must correspond to `s[p]` and `reverse(s)[q]`. The structure of LCS naturally aligns characters from `s` and `reverse(s)`. Specifically, if `s[x]` is matched with `reverse(s)[y]` in the LCS, it means `s[x]` is the same character as `s[length - 1 - y]`. This property ensures that the LCS itself will be a palindrome.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the LCS of `s` and `reverse(s)`.

**Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm:**

We can use a 2D dynamic programming table, `dp[i][j]`, to store the length of the LCS of `s[0...i-1]` and `reverse(s)[0...j-1]`.

The recurrence relation is as follows:
*   **Base Cases:**
    *   `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j`: LCS with an empty string is 0.
    *   `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i`: LCS with an empty string is 0.

*   **For `i > 0` and `j > 0`:**
    *   If `s[i-1] == reverse(s)[j-1]` (i.e., the current characters match):
        The LCS includes this matching character. So, `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    *   If `s[i-1] != reverse(s)[j-1]` (i.e., the current characters do not match):
        The LCS does not include both of these characters. We must choose to either exclude `s[i-1]` or `reverse(s)[j-1]`. We take the maximum of these two possibilities:
        `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

The final answer will be `dp[n][n]`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

**Constraints:**
The length of `s` is between 1 and 30. This is a very small constraint, making the `O(N^2)` time complexity of this DP approach extremely efficient (30*30 = 900 operations). The space complexity is also `O(N^2)`, which is negligible for N=30.

**Example: `s = "bananas"`**

1.  `s = "bananas"` (N=7)
2.  `reversed_s = "sananab"`
3.  Initialize `dp` table of size (8x8) with zeros.

The `dp` table calculation will proceed cell by cell:
`dp[i][j]` =
- `1 + dp[i-1][j-1]` if `s[i-1] == reversed_s[j-1]`
- `max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` otherwise

After filling the table, `dp[7][7]` will contain the length of the LPS. For "bananas", the longest palindromic subsequence is "anana", with length 5. The algorithm will correctly output 5.
