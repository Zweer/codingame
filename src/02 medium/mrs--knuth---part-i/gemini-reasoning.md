The problem "Mrs. Knuth - Part I" is a classic exact cover problem, which can be solved efficiently using Algorithm X (Knuth's Dancing Links). The puzzle description hints at this by mentioning "Algorithm X tutorial" and being "Part I".

**1. Problem Analysis and Exact Cover Formulation:**

To apply Algorithm X, we need to identify the "items" (constraints to be satisfied) and "options" (choices that satisfy some of these constraints).

*   **Items (Columns in the DLX Matrix):**
    *   **Student Items (`S_StudentName`):** Each student must receive exactly one lesson. So, for every student, we create a unique column.
    *   **Time Slot Items (`T_Day_Hour`):** Each available time slot for Mrs. Knuth (e.g., Monday 8 AM, Thursday 2 PM) must be filled by exactly one student. For every (Day, Hour) pair Mrs. Knuth is available, we create a column.
    *   **Instrument-Per-Day Items (`I_Day_Instrument`):** Mrs. Knuth refuses to teach the same instrument more than once per day. For every day Mrs. Knuth teaches, and for every possible instrument, we create a column to ensure that instrument is used at most once on that day. The problem constraints guarantee that the number of students for each instrument type equals the number of days Mrs. Knuth teaches, ensuring a solution exists where each instrument is used on a different teaching day.

*   **Options (Rows in the DLX Matrix):**
    Each option represents a potential assignment of a student to a lesson slot: `(Student, Instrument, Day, Hour)`. An option is valid if:
    1.  The student is available at the specified `(Day, Hour)`.
    2.  Mrs. Knuth is available at the specified `(Day, Hour)`.

    If a valid option `(Student_X, Instrument_Y, Day_Z, Hour_W)` is chosen, it covers the following items:
    *   `S_{Student_X}` (Student X gets their lesson)
    *   `T_{Day_Z}_{Hour_W}` (Time slot (Day Z, Hour W) is filled)
    *   `I_{Day_Z}_{Instrument_Y}` (Instrument Y is taught on Day Z)

**2. Input Pre-processing:**

*   **Mrs. Knuth's Availability (`teacherAvailability`):** Parse this string into a `Map<DayIndex, Set<Hour>>`. Crucially, the problem states "Mrs. Knuth will teach the same number of hours on each day she teaches." Combined with "numStudents = Mrs. Knuth's available hours per week", this implies that the number of available hours Mrs. Knuth has on each day she teaches must be identical. For example, if she's available 3 hours on Monday and 3 hours on Wednesday, she will teach 3 hours on Monday and 3 hours on Wednesday. The input implicitly guarantees this consistency.
*   **Student Data:** Parse each student line into an object containing `name`, `instrument`, and their `availability` (also `Map<DayIndex, Set<Hour>>`). Collect all unique instruments from the student list.

**3. Dancing Links Implementation Details:**

*   **`DLXNode` Class:** Represents a cell in the matrix. It has `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` pointers for the doubly circular linked list structure, a reference to its `column` header, and a `rowId` to identify the original option it belongs to.
*   **`ColumnHeader` Class:** Extends `DLXNode`, adding `size` (number of nodes in the column, used for Knuth's heuristic) and `name` (the item name, e.g., "S_Ayla").
*   **`DancingLinksSolver` Class:**
    *   `root`: A special `ColumnHeader` that serves as the entry point to the matrix.
    *   `columnHeaders`: A `Map` to quickly access `ColumnHeader` objects by their name.
    *   `optionDetails`: An array that stores the original data for each row (`[studentName, instrument, dayIndex, hour]`), indexed by `rowId`.
    *   `solution`: An array to store the `rowId`s of the chosen options that form the exact cover.
    *   **`addColumn(name)`:** Creates and links a new `ColumnHeader` horizontally to the `root`.
    *   **`addRow(columnNames, details)`:** Creates `DLXNode`s for each `columnName` in the given row. These nodes are linked horizontally to form a row and vertically to their respective column headers. It increments column sizes.
    *   **`hide(c: ColumnHeader)`:** Removes column `c` and all rows intersecting `c` (and their nodes in other columns) from the matrix. This is achieved by adjusting horizontal and vertical pointers and decrementing column sizes.
    *   **`unhide(c: ColumnHeader)`:** Reverses the `hide` operation, restoring the matrix state for backtracking.
    *   **`solve()`:** The recursive backtracking function.
        *   Base case: If `root.right` is `root`, all columns are covered, a solution is found.
        *   Heuristic: Selects the column with the minimum number of `1`s (smallest `size`) to minimize branching (Knuth's "S" heuristic).
        *   Iterates through each row in the chosen column, attempts to include it in the solution, recursively calls `solve()`, and backtracks if no solution is found.

**4. Output Formatting:**

*   A 2D array `schedule[displayRowIndex][dayIndex]` is initialized with "--------------".
*   The `solution` from the DLX solver (an array of `rowId`s) is used to populate this grid with "Name/Instrument" strings.
*   The output then generates 10 lines according to the specified formatting rules:
    *   Header row: Days of the week, center-justified, with specific padding.
    *   Hour rows: Hours right-justified in the first column, schedule content center-justified.
    *   LUNCH row: "LUNCH" center-justified in the schedule columns.
*   Trailing spaces are removed from each line using `trimEnd()`.
