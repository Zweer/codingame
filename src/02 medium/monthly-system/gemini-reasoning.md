The puzzle asks us to perform addition in a custom base-12 system, where each "digit" is represented by a three-letter month abbreviation. "Jan" represents 0, "Feb" represents 1, and so on, up to "Dec" which represents 11. We are given `N` numbers in this base-12 system, and our goal is to find their sum, also represented in the same base-12 system.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Understanding the Base-12 System:**
    *   The months are: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
    *   There are 12 months, mapping directly to digits 0-11 in a base-12 system.
    *   Mapping:
        *   Jan = 0
        *   Feb = 1
        *   Mar = 2
        *   Apr = 3
        *   May = 4
        *   Jun = 5
        *   Jul = 6
        *   Aug = 7
        *   Sep = 8
        *   Oct = 9
        *   Nov = 10
        *   Dec = 11

2.  **Conversion Strategy:**
    *   The easiest way to perform arithmetic with custom bases is to convert the numbers to a standard base (like base-10, i.e., decimal), perform the operation (addition in this case), and then convert the result back to the custom base.

3.  **Step-by-Step Plan:**
    *   **Mapping Setup:** Create two mappings:
        *   One to convert month abbreviations (e.g., "Jan") to their corresponding integer values (0-11).
        *   One to convert integer values (0-11) back to month abbreviations.
    *   **Base-12 to Decimal Conversion Function:**
        *   This function will take a string like "FebSepDec" as input.
        *   It will parse the string three characters at a time, each representing a "digit" in base-12.
        *   For each digit, it will look up its integer value.
        *   It will then apply the standard positional notation formula: `digit * base^position`. For example, "FebSepDec" (1, 8, 11 in base-12) converts to `1 * 12^2 + 8 * 12^1 + 11 * 12^0` in base-10.
    *   **Decimal to Base-12 Conversion Function:**
        *   This function will take a decimal integer as input.
        *   It will use the standard method of repeated division by the base (12 in this case).
        *   The remainders, read in reverse order of calculation, will form the digits of the base-12 number.
        *   Each remainder (0-11) will then be converted back to its corresponding month abbreviation.
        *   A special case for `0` (which should result in "Jan") needs to be handled, as the division loop won't run for `0`.
    *   **Main Program Flow:**
        *   Read `N`, the number of base-12 strings.
        *   Initialize a running total in decimal (base-10) to `0`.
        *   Loop `N` times:
            *   Read each base-12 string.
            *   Convert it to its decimal equivalent using the `base12ToDecimal` function.
            *   Add this decimal value to the running total.
        *   After the loop, convert the final decimal total back into a base-12 string using the `decimalToBase12` function.
        *   Print the resulting base-12 string.

4.  **Data Type Considerations:**
    *   TypeScript's `number` type is a 64-bit floating-point number, which can safely represent integers up to `2^53 - 1` without loss of precision (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`). For typical CodinGame constraints, this is usually sufficient unless the problem explicitly states or implies extremely large numbers (e.g., beyond `10^18`). The example input suggests numbers of moderate size, so `number` should be fine. If larger numbers were possible, `BigInt` would be required.

The provided example "FebSepDec" + "JunMarJan" -> "JulNovDec" confirms this approach:
*   "FebSepDec" (1,8,11 base-12) = `1*144 + 8*12 + 11*1 = 144 + 96 + 11 = 251` (base-10)
*   "JunMarJan" (5,2,0 base-12) = `5*144 + 2*12 + 0*1 = 720 + 24 + 0 = 744` (base-10)
*   Sum = `251 + 744 = 995` (base-10)
*   Convert 995 to base-12:
    *   `995 / 12 = 82` remainder `11` (Dec)
    *   `82 / 12 = 6` remainder `10` (Nov)
    *   `6 / 12 = 0` remainder `6` (Jul)
*   Reading remainders from bottom up: `JulNovDec`. This matches the example output.
