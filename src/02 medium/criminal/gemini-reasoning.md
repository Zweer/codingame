The problem asks us to count how many "people" can see the "criminal" ('Y') on a grid. The grid has dimensions `H` (height) and `W` (width). Different characters represent empty space (`.`), the criminal (`Y`), people looking in various directions (`^`, `v`, `<`, `>`), or obstacles (any other character). A key rule states that other people also act as obstacles.

The core of the problem lies in correctly interpreting and implementing the "field of vision" and "obstacle blocking" rules.

**1. Field of Vision (FoV) Geometry:**
The FoV expands by two characters per unit of distance, starting with a width of 3 at distance 1. This means at a distance `d` from the person, the visible region has a width of `2*d + 1`. If a person is at `(pX, pY)`:
*   **Looking vertically (`v` or `^`):** At a vertical distance `d` (i.e., row `pY +/- d`), the visible columns range from `pX - d` to `pX + d`.
*   **Looking horizontally (`<` or `>`):** At a horizontal distance `d` (i.e., column `pX +/- d`), the visible rows range from `pY - d` to `pY + d`.
We can define `target_d` as the linear distance along the person's primary viewing axis (e.g., `|yY - pY|` for vertical vision) and `target_offset` as the perpendicular offset from the central ray (e.g., `yX - pX` for vertical vision).
For the criminal `Y` at `(yX, yY)` to be within a person's basic FoV (ignoring obstacles for a moment):
*   `target_d` must be greater than 0 (a person cannot see themselves).
*   `abs(target_offset)` must be less than or equal to `target_d`.
*   `Y` must be in the correct forward direction (e.g., for `v`, `yY` must be greater than `pY`).

**2. Obstacle Blocking Logic:**
This is the most complex part. An obstacle blocks vision based on two rules:

*   **Central Obstacle:** If an obstacle is located directly on the central ray of the person's vision (i.e., `offset_obs === 0`), and the criminal `Y` is also on that central ray (`target_offset === 0`), then the criminal is blocked. "Everything that is behind cannot be seen."
*   **Side Obstacle (Widening Shadow):** If an obstacle is to the side of the central ray (`offset_obs !== 0`), it casts a shadow that widens by one character for each additional unit of distance from the obstacle.
    *   Let the obstacle be at `(d_obs, offset_obs)` relative to the person (distance `d_obs`, perpendicular `offset_obs`).
    *   The criminal `Y` is at `(target_d, target_offset)`.
    *   `Y` is blocked if:
        1.  It is on the same side of the central ray as the obstacle: `Math.sign(offset_obs) === Math.sign(target_offset)`. (This correctly implies that a side obstacle does not block the central ray, as `Math.sign(0)` is `0`).
        2.  Its `abs(target_offset)` falls within the shadow cone projected from the obstacle. The shadow widens by `(target_d - d_obs)` units on each side from the obstacle's `offset_obs`. So the shadowed range of offsets at `target_d` is `[offset_obs - (target_d - d_obs), offset_obs + (target_d - d_obs)]`.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Read Input:** Read `H` and `W`. Store the grid characters in a 2D array. Find and store the `(youX, youY)` coordinates of 'Y'.
2.  **Iterate People:** Loop through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
    *   If `grid[r][c]` is a person character (`^`, `v`, `<`, `>`):
        *   Call a helper function `canPersonSeeYou(pY, pX, pChar, yY, yX, H, W, grid)` to determine if this specific person can see 'Y'.
        *   If `true`, increment a `visiblePeopleCount`.
3.  **`canPersonSeeYou` Function:**
    *   Takes the person's coordinates `(pX, pY)`, their direction `pChar`, 'Y's coordinates `(yX, yY)`, grid dimensions, and the grid itself.
    *   **Calculate `target_d` and `target_offset`:** Based on the person's direction, determine the distance to `Y` along the viewing axis and `Y`'s perpendicular offset.
    *   **Initial FoV Check:** Apply the basic FoV and direction rules (as described in section 1). If `Y` is not in the cone or is behind the person, return `false`.
    *   **Obstacle Iteration:** Iterate `d_obs` from `1` up to `target_d - 1`. This loop checks for obstacles at each distance layer *between* the person and `Y`.
        *   For each `d_obs`, iterate `offset_obs` from `-d_obs` to `d_obs`. This covers all cells that *could* be obstacles at this distance layer within the basic FoV cone.
        *   Calculate the absolute grid coordinates `(ox, oy)` for this `(d_obs, offset_obs)` relative position.
        *   **Boundary Check:** Ensure `(ox, oy)` is within grid bounds.
        *   **Obstacle Detection:** Check if `grid[oy][ox]` is an obstacle (any character except `.` or `Y`).
        *   **Blocking Logic:** If an obstacle is found, apply the Central Obstacle and Side Obstacle rules (as described in section 2) to determine if this obstacle blocks `Y`. If it does, return `false` immediately.
    *   **Visibility Confirmed:** If the loops complete without `Y` being blocked by any obstacle, return `true`.
4.  **Print Result:** Output `visiblePeopleCount`.

**Complexity:**
The `canPersonSeeYou` function iterates `d_obs` up to `max(H, W)` times, and for each `d_obs`, it iterates `offset_obs` up to `2*max(H, W)` times. So, `canPersonSeeYou` is `O(max(H, W)^2)`.
The main loop iterates through all `H*W` cells to find people.
Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(H * W * max(H, W)^2)`.
Given `H, W < 256` (max 255), this could be `255 * 255 * 255^2`, which is approximately `4 * 10^9` operations. This is generally too slow for typical time limits (usually `10^8` ops/sec). However, it's a direct implementation of the rules, and sometimes CodinGame puzzles have test cases that don't hit the worst-case scenario, or constraints allow for higher complexity.
