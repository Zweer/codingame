The puzzle asks us to "de-FizzBuzz" a given string. This means, given a string that *might* have been produced by a specific FizzBuzzer machine, we need to find the *smallest positive integer* (up to 1000) that would generate that string. If no such integer exists, we output "ERROR".

The FizzBuzzer machine has a specific set of rules for converting an integer to a string:
1.  Produce "Fizz" for each time the digit `3` appears in the integer.
2.  Produce "Fizz" for each time the integer can be divided by `3`.
3.  Produce "Buzz" for each time the digit `5` appears in the integer.
4.  Produce "Buzz" for each time the integer can be divided by `5`.
5.  If no "Fizz" or "Buzz" has been produced so far, produce the original integer as the substring.
The substrings are concatenated in the order of these rules.

**Strategy:**

Given the constraint that the target integer must be between 1 and 1000, the most efficient strategy is to pre-compute all possible outputs of the FizzBuzzer for integers from 1 to 1000.

1.  **Forward Mapping Function (`fizzBuzzer`):** We'll first implement the `fizzBuzzer(n: number)` function exactly as described by the rules. This function will take an integer `n` and return the corresponding FizzBuzzer string.
    *   To check for digit appearances, we'll convert the number `n` to a string.
    *   We'll build the output string by concatenating "Fizz" and "Buzz" substrings according to the rules and their specified order.
    *   A final check will determine if the integer itself should be returned if no "Fizz" or "Buzz" was generated.

2.  **Pre-computation:** We'll iterate through integers `i` from 1 to 1000. For each `i`:
    *   Call `fizzBuzzer(i)` to get its output string `s`.
    *   Store this mapping in a `Map` (or dictionary) where the key is `s` and the value is `i`. Since we iterate `i` in ascending order, the first time we encounter a particular output string `s`, the `i` that produced it will inherently be the *smallest* integer for that `s`. We only need to store the first mapping for each unique output string.

3.  **Processing Queries:** For each input query string:
    *   Look up the query string in our pre-computed `Map`.
    *   If found, print the corresponding integer.
    *   If not found, print "ERROR".

This approach is efficient because the pre-computation step is very fast (1000 iterations, each involving simple string and arithmetic operations). Subsequent lookups are constant time on average (`Map.has` and `Map.get`). The maximum number of queries `N` is 100, which is also very small.

**Example Trace for FizzBuzzer(15):**
1.  `n = 15`, `nStr = "15"`. `result = ""`
2.  **Rule 1 (digit '3'):** `nStr` ("15") does not contain '3'. `result` remains `""`.
3.  **Rule 2 (divisible by 3):** `15 % 3 === 0` is true. `result += "Fizz"`. `result` is now `"Fizz"`.
4.  **Rule 3 (digit '5'):** `nStr` ("15") contains '5'. `result += "Buzz"`. `result` is now `"FizzBuzz"`.
5.  **Rule 4 (divisible by 5):** `15 % 5 === 0` is true. `result += "Buzz"`. `result` is now `"FizzBuzzBuzz"`.
6.  **Rule 5 (fallback):** `result` is not `""`. No change.
Final output for `fizzBuzzer(15)` is `"FizzBuzzBuzz"`.

**Code Structure:**



```typescript

 *
 * @param n The positive integer to process (1 to 1000).
 * @returns The string produced by the FizzBuzzer rules.
 */
function fizzBuzzer(n: number): string {
    let result = '';
    const nStr = String(n); // Convert number to string to check for digits

    // Rule 1: Produce "Fizz" for each time the digit '3' appears in the integer.
    for (const char of nStr) {

    if (result === '') {

    return result;
}

// Pre-compute the mappings from FizzBuzzer output strings to the smallest input integer.
// We use a Map<string, number> for efficient lookup.
const deFizzBuzzMap = new Map<string, number>();

// Iterate from 1 to 1000 (inclusive) as per constraints.
// We iterate in ascending order, so the first integer found for a given output string
// will always be the smallest.
for (let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    const outputString = fizzBuzzer(i);
    // Only set the mapping if it doesn't exist yet, preserving the smallest 'i'
    if (!deFizzBuzzMap.has(outputString)) {
        deFizzBuzzMap.set(outputString, i);
    }
}

// Read the number of strings to de-FizzBuzz.
const N: number = parseInt(readline());

// Process each query string.
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    const queryStr: string = readline();
    // Look up the query string in our pre-computed map.
    if (deFizzBuzzMap.has(queryStr)) {
        console.log(deFizzBuzzMap.get(queryStr));
    } else {
        // If the string is not found in the map, it means no integer from 1 to 1000
        // produces this string according to the FizzBuzzer rules.
        console.log('ERROR');
    }
