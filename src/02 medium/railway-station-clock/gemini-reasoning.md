The puzzle asks us to correct times observed from a faulty railway station clock. The clock has a consistent delay: for every four *true* minutes that pass, the clock falls behind by one second. The clock is reset daily at 8 AM. We need to convert an observed time (HH:MM:SS PP) to the true time.

**Understanding the Clock's Delay:**

The core of the problem lies in the clock's delay rate. "Every four minutes it goes behind by one more second" means that while 4 minutes (240 seconds) of *true* time elapse, the clock only advances by `(240 - 1) = 239` seconds.
This gives us a ratio:
`True Elapsed Time / Observed Elapsed Time = 240 / 239`

Therefore, `True Elapsed Time = Observed Elapsed Time * (240 / 239)`.

This relationship applies to the time elapsed since the last reset point, which is 8:00:00 AM.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Parse Input Time:**
    *   Read the input string `HH:MM:SS PP`.
    *   Separate the time part (`HH:MM:SS`) and the AM/PM part (`PP`).
    *   Parse `HH`, `MM`, `SS` into numbers.

2.  **Convert Observed Time to Total Seconds Since Midnight (24-hour format):**
    *   Convert the `HH` (12-hour format) to `HH24` (24-hour format).
        *   If `PP` is "PM": `HH24 = HH + 12` (unless `HH` is 12, then `HH24 = 12`).
        *   If `PP` is "AM": `HH24 = HH` (unless `HH` is 12, then `HH24 = 0` for 12 AM).
    *   Calculate `totalObservedSecondsSinceMidnight = HH24 * 3600 + MM * 60 + SS`.

3.  **Calculate Observed Duration from Last 8 AM Reset:**
    *   The reset point is 8 AM, which is `8 * 3600 = 28800` seconds from midnight.
    *   To find the observed duration since the *most recent* 8 AM reset, we use modular arithmetic to handle times before 8 AM (which refer to the previous day's reset).
    *   `observedDurationSince8AM = (totalObservedSecondsSinceMidnight - RESET_SECONDS_MIDNIGHT + SECONDS_IN_DAY) % SECONDS_IN_DAY`.

4.  **Calculate True Duration from Last 8 AM Reset:**
    *   Apply the delay formula: `trueDurationSince8AM = observedDurationSince8AM * (240 / 239)`.
    *   The problem guarantees that all test cases will result in whole seconds for true time, meaning `observedDurationSince8AM` will always be a multiple of 239 for the given inputs.

5.  **Calculate True Total Seconds Since Midnight:**
    *   Add the `trueDurationSince8AM` back to the `RESET_SECONDS_MIDNIGHT` and take it modulo `SECONDS_IN_DAY` to get the true time in total seconds since midnight.
    *   `trueTotalSecondsSinceMidnight = (RESET_SECONDS_MIDNIGHT + trueDurationSince8AM) % SECONDS_IN_DAY`.

6.  **Convert True Total Seconds to HH:MM:SS (12-hour format):**
    *   Derive `trueHH24`, `trueMM`, `trueSS` from `trueTotalSecondsSinceMidnight`.
    *   Convert `trueHH24` back to `trueHH_12hr` and determine `trueAMPM`:
        *   `00:xx:xx` (24-hour) is `12:xx:xx AM` (12-hour).
        *   `12:xx:xx` (24-hour) is `12:xx:xx PM` (12-hour).
        *   `01:xx:xx` to `11:xx:xx` (24-hour) are `1:xx:xx AM` to `11:xx:xx AM` (12-hour).
        *   `13:xx:xx` to `23:xx:xx` (24-hour) are `1:xx:xx PM` to `11:xx:xx PM` (12-hour).

7.  **Format Output:**
    *   Hours (`trueHH_12hr`) should not have a leading zero if less than 10 (e.g., `8`).
    *   Minutes (`trueMM`) and seconds (`trueSS`) should always have two digits (e.g., `03`, `59`), using `padStart(2, '0')`.
    *   Combine into the final string format: `HH:MM:SS PP`.

**Example Walkthrough (8:03:59 AM observed):**

1.  **Parse:** `HH=8`, `MM=3`, `SS=59`, `PP="AM"`.
2.  **Total Observed Seconds:** `observedHH24 = 8`. `totalObservedSecondsSinceMidnight = 8*3600 + 3*60 + 59 = 28800 + 180 + 59 = 29039`.
3.  **Observed Duration Since 8 AM:** `RESET_SECONDS_MIDNIGHT = 28800`.
    `observedDurationSince8AM = (29039 - 28800 + 86400) % 86400 = (239 + 86400) % 86400 = 239`.
4.  **True Duration Since 8 AM:** `trueDurationSince8AM = 239 * (240 / 239) = 240`.
5.  **True Total Seconds Since Midnight:**
    `trueTotalSecondsSinceMidnight = (28800 + 240) % 86400 = 29040 % 86400 = 29040`.
6.  **Convert to HH:MM:SS PP:**
    *   `trueHH24 = floor(29040 / 3600) = 8`.
    *   `remainingSeconds = 29040 % 3600 = 240`.
    *   `trueMM = floor(240 / 60) = 4`.
    *   `trueSS = 240 % 60 = 0`.
    *   `trueHH24 = 8` -> `trueHH_12hr = 8`, `trueAMPM = "AM"`.
7.  **Format Output:** `8:04:00 AM`.
