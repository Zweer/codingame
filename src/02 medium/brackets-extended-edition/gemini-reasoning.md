The problem asks us to determine if a given expression's bracketing can be made valid by "flipping" bracket characters in-place. Flipping means replacing an opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket (e.g., `(` becomes `)`) or a closing bracket with its corresponding opening bracket (e.g., `>` becomes `<`). We need to output `true` or `false` for `N` expressions.

**Constraints Analysis:**
- `N <= 50` (number of expressions)
- `expression length <= 10000`
- `number of bracketing elements <= 25` (This is the most critical constraint)

The constraint "number of bracketing elements <= 25" is key. Let `K` be the total count of bracket characters in an expression. This constraint means `K` is at most 25.

**Problem Breakdown and Approach:**

1.  **Identify Bracket Characters:** First, we need to extract only the bracket characters from the input expression. Any other characters (like `abc` in the example) are ignored as they don't affect bracketing validity.

2.  **Brute-Force with Bitmasks:** For each bracket character extracted, we have two choices:
    *   Keep it as its original character.
    *   Flip it to its counterpart.
    Since there are `K` bracket characters, there are `2^K` total combinations of choices (flips).
    Given `K <= 25`, `2^25` is approximately `3.3 * 10^7`. While `3.3 * 10^7` operations per expression is somewhat large, it might be acceptable if each operation is very fast or if average case performance is good. If all `N=50` expressions hit `K=25`, the total operations would be `50 * 2^25 * K` (where `K` is for validation), which is `50 * 3.3 * 10^7 * 25 â‰ˆ 4 * 10^{10}`, which would be too slow. However, in competitive programming, such constraints often imply that the worst-case `K` happens rarely, or there are early exits. For example, if `K` is odd, it's impossible to form valid pairs, so we can return `false` immediately.

3.  **Standard Bracket Validation:** For each of the `2^K` combinations, we form a temporary string consisting of only the interpreted bracket characters. Then, we validate this string using a standard stack-based algorithm:
    *   Push opening brackets onto the stack.
    *   When a closing bracket is encountered, pop from the stack. If the stack is empty or the popped bracket doesn't match, the sequence is invalid.
    *   At the end, if the stack is empty, the sequence is valid. This `isValid` function runs in `O(K)` time.

**Detailed Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize Lookup Tables:** Create sets for opening and closing brackets, and a map (`BRACKET_PAIRS`) to quickly find the counterpart of any bracket (e.g., `(` maps to `)`, and `)` maps to `(`).

2.  **`solveExpression(expression: string)` Function:**
    *   **Extract Brackets:** Iterate through the input `expression`. If a character is a bracket, add it to a `brackets` array.
    *   Let `K = brackets.length`.
    *   **Early Exit (Odd Count):** If `K` is odd, return `false` immediately. A valid bracket sequence must always have an even number of brackets.
    *   **Early Exit (No Brackets):** If `K` is 0 (no brackets found), return `true` as it's trivially valid.
    *   **Iterate Combinations:** Loop `i` from `0` to `(1 << K) - 1`. Each `i` represents a unique combination of flips:
        *   For each `j` from `0` to `K-1`:
            *   Get the `j`-th bracket character from the `brackets` array (`originalChar`).
            *   Check the `j`-th bit of `i` using `(i >> j) & 1`.
            *   If the bit is `0`, the `originalChar` is used as is.
            *   If the bit is `1`, `originalChar` is flipped using `BRACKET_PAIRS[originalChar]`.
            *   Append the `interpretedChar` to a `currentBracketSequence` string.
        *   **Validate:** Call `isValid(currentBracketSequence)`. If it returns `true`, then a valid combination has been found. Return `true` immediately for this expression.
    *   If the loop finishes without finding any valid combination, return `false`.

3.  **`isValid(s: string)` Function:**
    *   Initialize an empty `stack`.
    *   Iterate through each `char` in the input `s` (which contains only bracket characters):
        *   If `char` is an opening bracket, push it onto the `stack`.
        *   If `char` is a closing bracket:
            *   If the `stack` is empty, it's an unmatched closing bracket. Return `false`.
            *   Pop the top element (`lastOpen`) from the `stack`.
            *   If `BRACKET_PAIRS[lastOpen]` is not equal to `char`, it's a type mismatch (e.g., `(` closed by `]`). Return `false`.
    *   After iterating through all characters, if the `stack` is empty, it means all brackets were correctly matched. Return `true`. Otherwise, return `false` (unmatched opening brackets left on stack).

**Time Complexity:**
For each expression, we iterate `2^K` times. Inside the loop, we build a string of length `K` and then call `isValid`, which takes `O(K)` time. So, for one expression, the complexity is `O(2^K * K)`.
Total time complexity is `O(N * 2^K * K)`.
Given `N <= 50` and `K <= 25`, the maximum operations could be `50 * 2^25 * 25`, which is a large number. However, the `isValid` function often returns `false` very early, effectively pruning the search space and making the average case much faster. This approach is typical for problems where a small `K` allows for exponential complexity.

**Example Walkthrough: `<{[(abc(]}>`**
1.  Extracted brackets: `['<', '{', '[', '(', '(', ']', '}', '>']`. `K = 8`.
2.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `(1 << 8) - 1 = 255`.
3.  Consider `i` such that only the 5th bracket (the second `(` in the sequence, at original expression index 7) is flipped. All other bits are 0.
    *   Bracket sequence construction:
        *   `j=0`: `<` (bit 0, keep) -> `<`
        *   `j=1`: `{` (bit 0, keep) -> `{`
        *   `j=2`: `[` (bit 0, keep) -> `[`
        *   `j=3`: `(` (bit 0, keep) -> `(`
        *   `j=4`: `(` (bit 1, flip) -> `)`
        *   `j=5`: `]` (bit 0, keep) -> `]`
        *   `j=6`: `}` (bit 0, keep) -> `}`
        *   `j=7`: `>` (bit 0, keep) -> `>`
    *   `currentBracketSequence` becomes `<{()[]}>`.
    *   `isValid("<{()[]}>")` will return `true`.
    *   The `solveExpression` function immediately returns `true`.
