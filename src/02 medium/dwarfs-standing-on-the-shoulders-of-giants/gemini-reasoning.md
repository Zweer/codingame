The problem asks us to find the longest chain of influence between people. We are given `N` relationships, where each relationship `X Y` means that person `X` influences person `Y`. The "length" of a chain is defined as the number of people involved in it. For example, a chain `A -> B -> C` involves 3 people.

This problem can be modeled as finding the longest path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   **Nodes:** Each person (represented by an integer) is a node in the graph.
*   **Edges:** If `X` influences `Y`, there is a directed edge from `X` to `Y`.
*   **DAG Property:** The problem states that "If A influences B (even indirectly through other people), then B will not influence A (even indirectly). Also, you can not influence yourself." This guarantees that the graph has no cycles, making it a DAG.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** We'll use an adjacency list to represent the graph. A `Map<number, number[]>` is suitable, where the key is the influencer (`X`) and the value is an array of people `X` influences (`Y`). We also need to keep track of all unique people involved in any relationship, which can be stored in a `Set<number>`.

2.  **Dynamic Programming (DFS with Memoization):**
    For a DAG, the longest path can be found efficiently using dynamic programming. Let `dp[u]` be the length of the longest influence chain *starting* from person `u`.
    *   **Base Case:** If person `u` does not influence anyone (i.e., has no outgoing edges), the longest chain starting from `u` is just `u` itself. So, `dp[u] = 1`.
    *   **Recursive Step:** If person `u` influences `v1, v2, ..., vk`, then the longest chain starting from `u` would be `1 + max(dp[v1], dp[v2], ..., dp[vk])`. The `1` accounts for person `u` itself.
    *   **Memoization:** To avoid redundant computations and ensure efficiency, we store the computed `dp[u]` values in a `Map<number, number>` (our `memo` table). Before computing `dp[u]`, we check if it's already in the `memo` table. If it is, we return the stored value.

3.  **Overall Longest Chain:**
    Since the graph might consist of multiple disconnected components, or multiple "root" influencers (people who are not influenced by anyone in the given relationships), we need to compute the `dp` value for every unique person that appears in the input relationships. The overall longest chain will be the maximum value among all `dp[u]` computed.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  Read the number of relationships `N`.
2.  Initialize an empty `Map` `adj` for the adjacency list and an empty `Set` `allPeople` to store all unique individuals.
3.  Loop `N` times to read each relationship `X Y`:
    *   Add `Y` to `adj[X]`. If `adj[X]` doesn't exist, create it first.
    *   Add both `X` and `Y` to `allPeople`.
4.  Initialize an empty `Map` `memo` for memoization.
5.  Define the `dfs(u)` function:
    *   If `u` is in `memo`, return `memo.get(u)`.
    *   If `u` has no outgoing edges (i.e., `!adj.has(u)` or `adj.get(u)!.length === 0`), set `memo.set(u, 1)` and return 1. This is the base case.
    *   Initialize `maxLengthFromSuccessors = 0`.
    *   For each `v` in `adj.get(u)`:
        *   Recursively call `dfs(v)` and update `maxLengthFromSuccessors = Math.max(maxLengthFromSuccessors, dfs(v))`.
    *   Set `memo.set(u, 1 + maxLengthFromSuccessors)` and return `1 + maxLengthFromSuccessors`.
6.  Initialize `overallLongestChain = 0`.
7.  Iterate through each `person` in the `allPeople` set:
    *   Call `dfs(person)`.
    *   Update `overallLongestChain = Math.max(overallLongestChain, dfs(person))`.
8.  Print `overallLongestChain`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**
*   **Time Complexity:** Building the graph takes O(N) time. The DFS with memoization visits each node and each edge at most once. If `V` is the number of unique people and `E` is the number of relationships (`N`), the DFS part is O(V + E). The overall complexity is O(V + E). Given `N < 10000` and `X, Y < 10000`, `V` can be up to `2 * 10000` and `E` is `N`. This is efficient enough for the constraints.
*   **Space Complexity:** The adjacency list takes O(V + E) space, the `allPeople` set takes O(V) space, and the `memo` table takes O(V) space. The recursion stack for DFS can go up to O(V) in the worst case (a single long chain). Overall, the space complexity is O(V + E).
