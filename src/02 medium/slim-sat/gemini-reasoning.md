The problem asks us to determine if a given logical formula, containing one free variable 'X' and several fixed variables, can be made true. The formula uses `AND`, `OR`, `XOR` operations and is fully parenthesized.

**1. Input Parsing and Variable Storage:**
*   The first line is the formula string. It needs to be split into tokens (e.g., `(`, `A`, `AND`, `)`).
*   The second line `N` indicates the number of fixed variables.
*   The next `N` lines provide variable names and their boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). These fixed values are stored in a `Map` for quick lookup.

**2. Formula Evaluation Strategy:**
Since the formula is "fully parenthesized", this greatly simplifies parsing. We can use a standard two-stack algorithm, similar to evaluating infix expressions:
*   **`operandStack`**: Stores boolean values (operands) and intermediate results.
*   **`operatorStack`**: Stores operators (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`) and opening parentheses `(`.

The evaluation proceeds by iterating through the tokens of the formula:
*   **If `(`:** Push it onto the `operatorStack`. It marks the beginning of a sub-expression.
*   **If a variable (e.g., `A`, `B`, `X`):**
    *   If it's 'X', use the `xValue` (the specific truth value we are testing for 'X' in the current evaluation run).
    *   Otherwise, look up its fixed truth value from the `fixedVars` map.
    *   Push the resolved boolean value onto the `operandStack`.
*   **If an operator (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`):** Push it onto the `operatorStack`. (Since expressions are fully parenthesized, we don't need to worry about operator precedence rules here; parentheses explicitly dictate evaluation order.)
*   **If `)`:** This signals the end of a sub-expression.
    1.  Repeatedly pop the `operatorStack` and `operandStack` to perform operations until an opening `(` is encountered on the `operatorStack`.
    2.  For each operation, pop the right operand, then the operator, then the left operand.
    3.  Perform the operation (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`) and push the boolean result back onto the `operandStack`.
    4.  Finally, pop the matching `(` from the `operatorStack`.

**3. Performing Operations:**
A helper function `performOperation(left: boolean, op: string, right: boolean)` is used to calculate the result of `AND`, `OR`, or `XOR` based on their standard truth tables. `XOR` is true if and only if exactly one input is true (`left !== right`).

**4. Determining Satisfiability:**
The problem asks if the formula *can* be made true. This means we need to test two scenarios:
*   Evaluate the formula assuming `X` is `TRUE`.
*   Evaluate the formula assuming `X` is `FALSE`.

If either of these evaluations results in `TRUE`, then the formula is "Satisfiable". Otherwise, if both result in `FALSE`, the formula is "Unsatisfiable".

**Example Trace (`( A AND ( A OR X ) )` with `A=TRUE`, testing `X=TRUE`):**

Tokens: `(`, `A`, `AND`, `(`, `A`, `OR`, `X`, `)`, `)`

1.  `(`: `opStack = ["("]`
2.  `A` (is `TRUE`): `valStack = [TRUE]`
3.  `AND`: `opStack = ["(", "AND"]`
4.  `(`: `opStack = ["(", "AND", "("]`
5.  `A` (is `TRUE`): `valStack = [TRUE, TRUE]`
6.  `OR`: `opStack = ["(", "AND", "(", "OR"]`
7.  `X` (is `TRUE`): `valStack = [TRUE, TRUE, TRUE]`
8.  `)`:
    *   Pop `TRUE` (right), `OR` (op), `TRUE` (left). `TRUE OR TRUE = TRUE`. Push `TRUE`.
        `valStack = [TRUE, TRUE]`, `opStack = ["(", "AND", "("]`
    *   Pop `(`. `opStack = ["(", "AND"]`
9.  `)`:
    *   Pop `TRUE` (right), `AND` (op), `TRUE` (left). `TRUE AND TRUE = TRUE`. Push `TRUE`.
        `valStack = [TRUE]`, `opStack = ["("]`
    *   Pop `(`. `opStack = []`

End of tokens. `valStack` contains `[TRUE]`, `opStack` is empty. The formula evaluates to `TRUE` for `X=TRUE`. Thus, it's "Satisfiable".
