The puzzle asks us to implement a Mayan numeral calculator. Mayan numbers are base-20, composed of vertical sections, where each section represents a power of 20. We need to read the graphical representations of the 20 Mayan numerals (0-19), then read two Mayan numbers in their graphical form, perform a basic arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /), and finally output the result in Mayan graphical form.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Understand Mayan Numerals and Input Format:**
    *   **Base-20 System:** Mayan numbers use a base-20 system. A number like `(D_n D_{n-1} ... D_1 D_0)_20` represents `D_n * 20^n + D_{n-1} * 20^{n-1} + ... + D_1 * 20^1 + D_0 * 20^0`.
    *   **Graphical Representation:** Each Mayan numeral (0-19) is represented by an `L` (width) x `H` (height) block of ASCII characters.
    *   **Vertical Stacking:** A multi-digit Mayan number is formed by stacking these `H`x`L` blocks vertically. The topmost block represents the most significant digit (highest power of 20), and the bottommost block represents the least significant digit (20^0).
    *   **Input Structure:**
        *   `L`, `H`: Dimensions of a single numeral glyph.
        *   `H` lines: ASCII definitions of all 20 numerals. Each line is `20 * L` characters long, containing the first line of numeral 0, then numeral 1, etc., up to numeral 19. This pattern repeats for `H` lines.
        *   `S1` (number of lines for first number): Followed by `S1` lines describing the first Mayan number.
        *   `S2` (number of lines for second number): Followed by `S2` lines describing the second Mayan number.
        *   `OPERATION`: The arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

2.  **Key Data Structures:**
    *   To convert between Mayan graphical representation and decimal values, we need two mappings:
        *   `decimalToMayanGlyphs: string[][]`: An array where `decimalToMayanGlyphs[i]` stores an array of `H` strings, representing the ASCII glyph for the decimal value `i`.
        *   `mayanNumeralMap: Map<string, number>`: A map where the key is the joined string (all `H` lines concatenated with `\n`) of a Mayan numeral's glyph, and the value is its corresponding decimal integer (0-19). This allows fast lookup from graphical representation to value.

3.  **Core Logic - Conversion Functions:**

    *   **`mayanToDecimal(mayanNumberLines: string[]): bigint`:**
        *   This function takes an array of strings representing a full Mayan number (e.g., `S1` lines for the first number).
        *   It determines the number of Mayan digits by dividing the total lines `mayanNumberLines.length` by `H`.
        *   It iterates from the first (topmost, most significant) `H`x`L` block to the last (bottommost, least significant).
        *   For each block, it extracts the `H` lines, joins them into a single string key, and uses `mayanNumeralMap` to get its decimal value (0-19).
        *   It accumulates the total decimal value using base-20 arithmetic: `current_decimal_value = current_decimal_value * 20 + digit_value`.
        *   **Important:** Mayan numbers can be very large (up to `2^63`), so `BigInt` must be used for all decimal calculations in TypeScript.

    *   **`decimalToMayan(decimalValue: bigint): string[]`:**
        *   This function converts a decimal `BigInt` into an array of strings representing its Mayan graphical form.
        *   **Special Case for 0:** If `decimalValue` is `0n`, it directly returns `decimalToMayanGlyphs[0]` (the glyph for 0).
        *   For non-zero values, it repeatedly performs modulo 20 to get the least significant digit, then divides by 20. These digits are collected in an array (they will be in reverse order, i.e., least significant first).
        *   Finally, it iterates through the collected digits in reverse order (most significant first) and appends the corresponding `H` lines from `decimalToMayanGlyphs` to the result array.

4.  **Main Execution Flow:**
    *   Read `L` and `H`.
    *   Read the `H` lines defining the 20 numerals. Parse these lines to populate both `decimalToMayanGlyphs` and `mayanNumeralMap`.
    *   Read `S1` and the `S1` lines for the first number.
    *   Read `S2` and the `S2` lines for the second number.
    *   Read the `operation` symbol.
    *   Convert the two Mayan input numbers to decimal `BigInt` using `mayanToDecimal`.
    *   Perform the arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on the `BigInt` values.
    *   Convert the `BigInt` result back to Mayan graphical form using `decimalToMayan`.
    *   Print each line of the resulting Mayan number.

**Example Walkthrough (1 + 1):**

*   Input `L=4, H=4`.
*   Mappings `decimalToMayanGlyphs` and `mayanNumeralMap` are populated. E.g., glyph for `1` is `o...\n....\n....\n....`.
*   First number lines: `["o...", "....", "....", "...."]`.
    *   `mayanToDecimal` sees one digit. It looks up `o...\n....\n....\n....` in `mayanNumeralMap` which returns `1`.
    *   `decNum1` becomes `1n`.
*   Second number lines are identical. `decNum2` becomes `1n`.
*   Operation is `+`.
*   `result = 1n + 1n = 2n`.
*   `decimalToMayan(2n)`:
    *   `2n % 20n = 2n`. `tempDigits = [2]`. `decimalValue = 0n`.
    *   Loop finishes.
    *   Iterate `tempDigits` backwards: `i=0`, `digit=2`.
    *   Append `decimalToMayanGlyphs[2]` to output lines.
*   Output `decimalToMayanGlyphs[2]` (which is `oo..\n....\n....\n....`).
