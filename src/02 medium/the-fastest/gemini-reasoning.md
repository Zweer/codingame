## Reasoning

The problem requires us to find the fastest (smallest) time among a given list of marathon runner results. Each result is provided in `HH:MM:SS` format.

To determine the smallest time, we need a way to compare different time strings. A straightforward approach is to convert each time string into a single comparable numerical value, such as the total number of seconds from midnight.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Read `N`**: The first line of input gives us the count of time results we need to process.
2.  **Initialize Variables**: We'll need two variables:
    *   `minTimeInSeconds`: To store the smallest total seconds encountered so far. Initialize it to a very large value (e.g., `Infinity`) so that the first time processed will always be smaller.
    *   `minTimeString`: To store the `HH:MM:SS` string corresponding to `minTimeInSeconds`. This is what we'll output at the end.
3.  **Iterate `N` times**: For each of the `N` subsequent lines:
    *   **Read Time String**: Read the current time result in `HH:MM:SS` format.
    *   **Parse and Convert**: Split the time string (e.g., "10:15:46") into its hours, minutes, and seconds components. Convert these string parts into numbers.
    *   **Calculate Total Seconds**: Convert the hours, minutes, and seconds into a single cumulative number of seconds. The formula is: `total_seconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds`.
    *   **Compare and Update**: Compare this `current_total_seconds` with `minTimeInSeconds`.
        *   If `current_total_seconds` is less than `minTimeInSeconds`, it means we've found a new fastest time. Update `minTimeInSeconds` with `current_total_seconds` and `minTimeString` with the original `HH:MM:SS` string we just read.
4.  **Output**: After processing all `N` times, `minTimeString` will hold the fastest time result. Print this string.

This approach correctly handles the comparison of times, including leading zeros (e.g., `03:59:08` vs `10:15:46`) because the conversion to total seconds makes the comparison purely numerical. The constraints on `N` (up to 10) are very small, so this iterative approach is highly efficient.
