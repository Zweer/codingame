The puzzle asks us to convert a given simple fraction `X/Y` into its mixed number representation, following specific formatting rules and handling various edge cases.

Here's a breakdown of the approach and rules implementation:

1.  **Input Parsing:** We read the `X/Y` string, split it by `/`, and parse `X` and `Y` into numbers.

2.  **Division by Zero Handling (Rule 4):**
    *   The first check is for `Y === 0`. If true, we immediately print `"DIVISION BY ZERO"` and move to the next test case.

3.  **Zero Numerator Handling (Rule 5 - Zero does not have a sign):**
    *   If `X === 0` (e.g., `0/18891`), the fraction is `0`. We print `"0"` and proceed to the next test case. This specifically handles the "Zero does not have a sign" rule for the case where the entire fraction evaluates to zero.

4.  **Determine Overall Sign (Rule 5):**
    *   We determine if the final mixed number should be negative. This happens if `X` and `Y` have different signs (`(X < 0 && Y > 0) || (X > 0 && Y < 0)`). A `signPrefix` string (`"-"` or `""`) is prepared.
    *   For all subsequent calculations (integer part, remainder, simplification), we work with the absolute values of `X` and `Y` (`absX`, `absY`) to avoid complications with negative numbers in modulo operations or `Math.floor`.

5.  **Calculate Integer Part (`A`)**:
    *   The integer part is `Math.floor(absX / absY)`.

6.  **Calculate Remainder (`B`)**:
    *   The numerator of the fractional part is `absX % absY`.

7.  **Simplify Proper Fraction (`B/C`)**:
    *   The denominator of the fractional part is `absY`.
    *   If the `remainder` is not zero, we need to simplify the fraction `remainder / absY`.
    *   This is done by finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `remainder` and `absY` using the Euclidean algorithm.
    *   Both `remainder` and `absY` are then divided by their GCD to get the `simplifiedNumerator` and `simplifiedDenominator`.

8.  **Construct Output String Based on Rules:**
    *   **Rule 1 (Integer Part Only):** If `remainder === 0` (meaning `X/Y` is an exact integer, like `6/3`), the result is simply `signPrefix + integerPart`. No spaces.
    *   **Rule 2 (Proper Fraction Only):** If `integerPart === 0` (and `remainder !== 0`, because Rule 1 would have caught `remainder === 0`), the result is `signPrefix + simplifiedNumerator + "/" + simplifiedDenominator`. No spaces.
    *   **General Mixed Number Case:** If both `integerPart` and `remainder` are non-zero, the result is `signPrefix + integerPart + " " + simplifiedNumerator + "/" + simplifiedDenominator`. Exactly one space between the integer and fractional parts.

This systematic approach covers all specified rules and examples.
