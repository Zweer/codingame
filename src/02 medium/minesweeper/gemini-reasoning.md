The problem asks us to locate `nb` hidden mines in a Minesweeper grid. The grid contains three types of cells:
*   `.` (dot): This cell itself is not a mine, and none of its 8 surrounding cells contain a mine.
*   `n` (digit): This cell itself is not a mine, and exactly `n` of its 8 surrounding cells contain mines. `n` will be a digit from '1' to '8'.
*   `?` (question mark): This cell's status is unknown; it could contain a mine or not.

The output should list the `nb` mine locations as `col lin` (0-indexed), sorted by column then by line.

**Core Logic and Approach:**

1.  **Interpretation:** Based on standard Minesweeper rules and clarifying the example output, cells with `.` or `n` are "revealed" and are therefore *never* mines themselves. Only cells marked `?` in the input can be mines.

2.  **Grid Representation:** We'll use two 2D arrays:
    *   `initialClues[h][w]`: Stores the original input characters ('.', 'n', '?'). This remains constant.
    *   `mineStatus[h][w]`: Represents our current hypothesis about whether each cell is a mine. It can have three states:
        *   `'U'` (Unknown): A `?` cell that we haven't yet decided whether it's a mine.
        *   `'M'` (Mine): A `?` cell that we've decided is a mine.
        *   `'N'` (Not a mine): A cell that we've determined cannot be a mine (either it's a clue cell, or it's a `?` cell determined not to be a mine).

3.  **Pre-processing (Initial Deductions):**
    *   **Initialize `mineStatus`:**
        *   For cells where `initialClues[r][c]` is `?`, set `mineStatus[r][c] = 'U'`.
        *   For cells where `initialClues[r][c]` is `.` or a digit `n`, set `mineStatus[r][c] = 'N'` (as these are clue cells and cannot be mines).
    *   **Propagate `.` constraints:** Iterate through the `initialClues` grid. If a cell `(r, c)` contains `.` (dot), then all its 8 neighbors *cannot* be mines. If any of these neighbors `(nr, nc)` are currently `mineStatus[nr][nc] === 'U'`, change their status to `'N'`. This propagation might trigger further deductions (e.g., if a cell becomes 'N' and is a neighbor of another clue). We repeat this process iteratively until no more `U` cells can be marked `N`.

4.  **Identify Candidate Cells:** After pre-processing, collect all cells `(r, c)` where `mineStatus[r][c]` is still `'U'`. These are the only possible locations for the `nb` mines. Let's call this list `candidateCells`.

5.  **Backtracking Algorithm:**
    This is a combinatorial search problem. We need to choose `nb` locations from `candidateCells` to be mines and satisfy all clues. A recursive backtracking function `solve(k, minesPlacedCount)` is suitable:
    *   `k`: The index of the current `candidateCell` we are considering.
    *   `minesPlacedCount`: The number of mines placed so far in the current hypothesis.

    **Base Cases:**
    *   If `minesPlacedCount === nb`: We have successfully placed `nb` mines. Now, mark all remaining `candidateCells` (from index `k` to the end) as `'N'` (not mines) because we've met our `nb` quota. Then, call a `validateGrid()` function to check if this full configuration satisfies *all* digit (`n`) and `.` clues across the entire grid. If valid, we found the solution; record the mine locations and return `true`. Otherwise, backtrack by resetting the temporary `'N'`s to `'U'` and return `false`.
    *   If `k === candidateCells.length`: We've exhausted all candidate cells. If `minesPlacedCount` is not `nb`, this path is invalid. Return `false`.

    **Pruning / Optimization:**
    *   If `minesPlacedCount + (candidateCells.length - k) < nb`: Even if all remaining `U` cells become mines, we cannot reach the required `nb` count. Prune this path early; return `false`.

    **Recursive Step for `candidateCells[k]`:**
    *   Get the coordinates `(r, c)` of `candidateCells[k]`.
    *   **Option 1: Place a mine at `(r, c)`:**
        *   Set `mineStatus[r][c] = 'M'`.
        *   Call `isValidPartialPlacement()`: This function checks if the current `mineStatus` (with `U`s, `N`s, and `M`s) immediately violates any clue. It primarily checks if any digit clue `k` now has `currentMines > k` or `currentMines + unknownNeighbors < k`, or if any `.` clue now has `currentMines > 0`. If `isValidPartialPlacement()` returns `false`, this path is invalid, and we immediately backtrack.
        *   If valid, recursively call `solve(k + 1, minesPlacedCount + 1)`. If it returns `true`, propagate `true` upwards.
        *   **Backtrack:** Reset `mineStatus[r][c] = 'U'`.
    *   **Option 2: Do NOT place a mine at `(r, c)`:**
        *   Set `mineStatus[r][c] = 'N'`.
        *   Call `isValidPartialPlacement()`. If `false`, backtrack.
        *   If valid, recursively call `solve(k + 1, minesPlacedCount)`. If it returns `true`, propagate `true` upwards.
        *   **Backtrack:** Reset `mineStatus[r][c] = 'U'`.

6.  **Output Formatting:** Once `solve` returns `true`, the `finalMines` array will contain the mine locations. Sort this array first by column (`c`) in ascending order, then by row (`r`) in ascending order for ties, and print them as `col lin`.

**Complexity:**
The time complexity is roughly `C(C, nb) * O(H*W)` in the worst case (where `C` is the number of candidate `?` cells and `H*W` is the cost of `isValidPartialPlacement`). Given `H, W <= 20` and `nb <= 20`, `H*W <= 400`. While `C(400, 20)` is mathematically huge, the strong pruning provided by `isValidPartialPlacement` (especially `currentMines > requiredMines` and `currentMines + unknownNeighbors < requiredMines`) significantly cuts down the search space in practice for Minesweeper puzzles. The problem guarantees a valid puzzle, often implying a unique and quickly discoverable solution.
