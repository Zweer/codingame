The problem asks us to find the maximum possible production a city can achieve, given that its happiness must remain non-negative. We are given `N` additional places (nodes 1 to `N`) and `L` links between places. City Hall (node 0) is always present and is a "House" type.

**Understanding City Mechanics:**

1.  **Places and Objects:**
    *   Nodes 0 to `N` represent places. Node 0 is City Hall, fixed as a "House".
    *   Nodes 1 to `N` can be assigned one of three object types:
        *   **House (H):** No direct effect on happiness.
        *   **Entertainment (E):** +1 happiness.
        *   **Factory (F):** -1 happiness.

2.  **Links (Roads):**
    *   Links connect two places. Their effect depends on the types of objects placed at their ends.
    *   **Blue Link (H-F or F-H):** +1 production.
    *   **Green Link (H-E or E-H):** +1 happiness.
    *   **Red Link (F-E or E-F):** -1 happiness.
    *   **White Link (Same Type):** Neutral (no effect).

**Constraints and Approach:**

*   `1 < N <= 11`: This constraint is crucial. It means the total number of non-City Hall places (`N`) is small.
*   The number of possible object assignments for nodes 1 to `N` is `3^N` (3 types for each of `N` places).
*   For `N=11`, `3^11 = 177,147`. This number of combinations is small enough to be checked using a brute-force approach.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Input Reading:** Read `N`, `L`, and then `L` link pairs. Store the links in an array.

2.  **Object Type Encoding:** We can represent the object types numerically for convenience:
    *   House (H): `0`
    *   Entertainment (E): `1`
    *   Factory (F): `2`

3.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize `maxProduction = 0`. An all-House configuration for nodes 1 to `N` (node 0 is already a House) will always result in 0 production and 0 happiness, satisfying the non-negative happiness constraint. Thus, 0 production is always achievable as a baseline.

4.  **Brute-Force Combinations:**
    *   Iterate through all possible `3^N` combinations of object assignments for nodes 1 to `N`.
    *   A common way to generate these combinations is to use a loop from `0` to `3^N - 1`. Each integer `i` in this range can be interpreted as a base-3 number. The digits of this base-3 number correspond to the object types for nodes 1, 2, ..., `N`.
        *   For example, if `N=3`, `i=0` (000 in base 3) would mean node 1 is H, node 2 is H, node 3 is H.
        *   `i=13` (111 in base 3) would mean node 1 is E, node 2 is E, node 3 is E.

5.  **Calculate Metrics for Each Combination:**
    *   For each combination `i`:
        *   Create an `objectTypes` array of size `N+1`.
        *   Set `objectTypes[0] = 0` (City Hall is House).
        *   Populate `objectTypes[1]` to `objectTypes[N]` based on the current base-3 combination `i`.
        *   Initialize `currentProduction = 0` and `currentHappiness = 0`.
        *   **Direct Happiness:** Iterate from node 1 to `N`. Add `HAPPINESS_EFFECT_DIRECT[objectTypes[nodeIdx]]` to `currentHappiness`.
        *   **Link Effects:** Iterate through all `L` links. For each link `(u, v)`:
            *   Get `typeU = objectTypes[u]` and `typeV = objectTypes[v]`.
            *   Apply the link rules:
                *   If `(typeU=H && typeV=F) || (typeU=F && typeV=H)`: `currentProduction += 1`.
                *   If `(typeU=H && typeV=E) || (typeU=E && typeV=H)`: `currentHappiness += 1`.
                *   If `(typeU=F && typeV=E) || (typeU=E && typeV=F)`: `currentHappiness -= 1`.

6.  **Update Max Production:**
    *   After calculating `currentHappiness` and `currentProduction` for a configuration, check if `currentHappiness >= 0`.
    *   If it is, update `maxProduction = Math.max(maxProduction, currentProduction)`.

7.  **Output:** After checking all combinations, `maxProduction` will hold the highest production value achieved under the happiness constraint. Print this value.

**Example Trace (from problem description):**
N=3, L=3, Links: (0,1), (0,2), (2,3)
Proposed Solution: Node 1=E, Node 2=F, Node 3=H.
`objectTypes` = [H(0), E(1), F(2), H(0)]

1.  **Direct Happiness:**
    *   Node 1 (E): `+1`
    *   Node 2 (F): `-1`
    *   Node 3 (H): `+0`
    *   Initial `currentHappiness = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0`.

2.  **Link Effects:**
    *   Link (0,1): (H,E) -> Green -> `currentHappiness += 1`. (`currentHappiness` becomes 1).
    *   Link (0,2): (H,F) -> Blue -> `currentProduction += 1`. (`currentProduction` becomes 1).
    *   Link (2,3): (F,H) -> Blue -> `currentProduction += 1`. (`currentProduction` becomes 2).

3.  **Result:** `currentProduction = 2`, `currentHappiness = 1`.
    Since `currentHappiness (1)` is `>= 0`, this is a valid configuration. `maxProduction` is updated to `2`.

This matches the example's output, confirming the logic.
