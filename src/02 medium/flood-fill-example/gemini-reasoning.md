The problem asks us to simulate the spread of "defense towers" on a grid and determine which tower (or combination of towers) claims each visitable spot. The core concept is based on proximity: the closest tower claims the spot. Ties are special: if multiple distinct tower origins (even with the same ID) can reach a spot at the *exact same minimum distance*, that spot is marked with a `'+'`. Unvisitable spots (`'#'`) and spots never reached remain unchanged.

This problem is a classic application of a **Multi-Source Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Instead of starting the BFS from a single point, we initiate it from all tower locations simultaneously.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Data Structures for BFS State:**
    *   `minDist[row][col]`: A 2D array to store the minimum distance from *any* tower to the cell at `(row, col)`. Initialized to `Infinity` for all cells.
    *   `reachedByOrigins[row][col]`: A 2D array of `Set<string>`. For each cell, this set will store unique identifiers of the *specific tower origins* that can reach this cell at its `minDist`. A unique origin identifier combines the tower's ID and its starting coordinates (e.g., "A_0_0" for tower 'A' starting at row 0, col 0). This is crucial for handling the tie-breaking rule ("even if both towers share the same I.D.").
    *   `queue`: A standard BFS queue that stores `(row, col, dist, origin)` tuples. `origin` here refers to the `TowerOrigin` object, allowing us to track which specific tower instance is propagating.
    *   `TowerOrigin` class: A custom class to encapsulate a tower's ID, its starting coordinates, and generate a `uniqueKey` for it.
    *   `towerOriginMap`: A `Map` to quickly retrieve `TowerOrigin` objects using their `uniqueKey`.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Read the grid dimensions `W` and `H`, and then the grid content.
    *   Iterate through the initial grid to identify all tower locations:
        *   For each character that is not `'.'`, `'#'`, or `'+'`, create a `TowerOrigin` object.
        *   Add this `TowerOrigin` to `towerOriginMap`.
        *   Set `minDist` for the tower's starting cell to `0`.
        *   Add the tower's `uniqueKey` to `reachedByOrigins` for its starting cell.
        *   Enqueue a `CellQueueItem` for the tower's starting cell with distance `0` and its `TowerOrigin`.

3.  **BFS Traversal:**
    *   Use a `head` pointer for an array-based queue for efficiency in TypeScript (simulating a `deque`).
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a `CellQueueItem` `(r, c, dist, origin)`.
        *   Consider all four cardinal neighbors `(nr, nc)` (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):
            *   **Boundary Check:** Ensure `(nr, nc)` is within the grid limits.
            *   **Obstacle Check:** If `grid[nr][nc]` is `'#'`, skip this neighbor as troops cannot pass through it.
            *   Calculate `newDist = dist + 1`.
            *   **Case 1: Faster Path Found:** If `newDist < minDist[nr][nc]`:
                *   This `origin` found a new shortest path to `(nr, nc)`.
                *   Update `minDist[nr][nc] = newDist`.
                *   Clear `reachedByOrigins[nr][nc]` (because previous paths are now longer).
                *   Add `origin.uniqueKey` to `reachedByOrigins[nr][nc]`.
                *   Enqueue `(nr, nc, newDist, origin)` to continue the propagation.
            *   **Case 2: Same-Time Path Found:** If `newDist === minDist[nr][nc]`:
                *   This `origin` reaches `(nr, nc)` at the same minimum distance as others.
                *   Add `origin.uniqueKey` to `reachedByOrigins[nr][nc]`.
                *   **Important:** Only enqueue `(nr, nc, newDist, origin)` if `origin.uniqueKey` was not already in `reachedByOrigins[nr][nc]`. This prevents redundant propagation from the same origin to the same cell at the same distance via multiple paths.

4.  **Constructing the Result Grid:**
    *   Create a new `resultGrid` to store the final map.
    *   Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the grid:
        *   If `originalChar` at `(r, c)` is `'#'`: The cell remains `'#'` (Rule 7, and handled in BFS).
        *   If `minDist[r][c]` is `Infinity`: This cell was never reached by any tower. It retains its `originalChar` (Rule 7). This applies to initial `'.'` cells that are isolated.
        *   Otherwise (the cell was reached):
            *   If `reachedByOrigins[r][c].size > 1`: Multiple distinct tower origins reached this cell at the same minimum distance. Mark it `'+'`.
            *   If `reachedByOrigins[r][c].size === 1`: Exactly one unique tower origin claimed this cell. Retrieve its `id` from the `towerOriginMap` using the stored `uniqueKey` and mark the cell with that `id`.

5.  **Output:**
    *   Print each row of the `resultGrid`, joined into a string.

**Example Walkthrough for Tie-Breaker (`+`):**
Consider the example provided in the problem description, focusing on cell `(0,2)` (first row, third column, 0-indexed):
`...#.`
`A#...`
`#..B.`
`.....`

*   Tower `A` starts at `(1,0)`. Its unique key might be `A_1_0`.
*   Tower `B` starts at `(2,3)`. Its unique key might be `B_2_3`.

Paths to `(0,2)`:
*   **From A (`A_1_0`):** `(1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2)`. This path has length 3.
*   **From B (`B_2_3`):** `(2,3) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)`. This path also has length 3.

During BFS:
1.  `A_1_0` explores `(0,0)` (dist 1), then `(0,0)` explores `(0,1)` (dist 2), then `(0,1)` explores `(0,2)` (dist 3).
    *   At this point, `minDist[0][2]` becomes `3`, and `reachedByOrigins[0][2]` is `{A_1_0}`. `(0,2)` is enqueued for `A_1_0`.
2.  Independently, `B_2_3` explores `(2,2)` (dist 1), then `(2,2)` explores `(1,2)` (dist 2), then `(1,2)` explores `(0,2)` (dist 3).
    *   When `(1,2)` (from `B_2_3`) tries to visit `(0,2)` at `newDist = 3`:
        *   `newDist (3)` is equal to `minDist[0][2]` (which is `3`).
        *   `B_2_3` is not yet in `reachedByOrigins[0][2]`.
        *   So, `B_2_3`'s key is added to `reachedByOrigins[0][2]`, making it `{A_1_0, B_2_3}`.
        *   `(0,2)` is enqueued for `B_2_3` to continue its propagation.

After the BFS completes, when constructing the `resultGrid` for `(0,2)`:
*   `minDist[0][2]` is `3` (finite).
*   `reachedByOrigins[0][2].size` is `2` (because it contains both `A_1_0` and `B_2_3`).
*   Therefore, `resultGrid[0][2]` is correctly set to `'+'`.

This detailed approach correctly handles all rules, especially the nuanced tie-breaking condition involving same-ID towers. The constraints (W, H <= 30) ensure that this BFS solution will perform well within typical time limits.
