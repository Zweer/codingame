The problem asks us to identify the failed optical link(s) given a link code matrix and an alarm code vector. We are told that at most `failures` links can fail (where `failures` is 1 or 2). If the failed link(s) can be uniquely determined, we output their identifiers. Otherwise, if multiple scenarios (single or dual link failures) explain the observed alarm, or if no scenario explains it, we output "AMBIGUOUS".

**Problem Breakdown:**

1.  **Input Parsing:** We need to read the number of links, m-trails, maximum failures, the alarm code vector, and the link code matrix.
    *   The link code matrix `linkCodeMatrix[i][j]` is 1 if m-trail `m_j` uses link `l_i`, and 0 otherwise.
    *   The alarm code vector `alarmCodeVector[j]` is 1 if `m_j` generated an alarm, and 0 otherwise.

2.  **Failure Mechanism:**
    *   If a link `l_k` fails, any m-trail `m_j` that uses `l_k` will generate an alarm.
    *   If multiple links fail (e.g., `l_k1`, `l_k2`), an m-trail `m_j` will generate an alarm if it uses *any* of the failed links. This means the alarm for `m_j` is `1` if `linkCodeMatrix[k1][j] == 1` OR `linkCodeMatrix[k2][j] == 1` (or more generally, an OR over all failed links in the set).

3.  **Solution Strategy (Brute Force):**
    Since the number of links and m-trails is small (`links` up to 90, `mtrails` up to 20), we can iterate through all possible failure scenarios (single link failures and, if `failures` allows, dual link failures) and check if they produce the observed `alarmCodeVector`.

    *   **Candidate Generation:**
        *   **Single Failures:** For each link `l_i` (from `0` to `links - 1`), consider the scenario where only `l_i` fails.
        *   **Dual Failures (if `failures = 2`):** For each unique pair of links `(l_i, l_j)` where `i < j`, consider the scenario where both `l_i` and `l_j` fail.

    *   **Validation for each Candidate Set `F` (of failed links):**
        1.  Construct an `expectedAlarmCode` vector, initialized to all zeros.
        2.  For each m-trail `m_t` (from `0` to `mtrails - 1`):
            *   Iterate through each link `l_f` in the candidate set `F`.
            *   If `linkCodeMatrix[f][t]` is 1 (meaning `m_t` uses `l_f`), then `m_t` *must* alarm. Set `expectedAlarmCode[t] = 1` and move to the next m-trail (since one failed link is enough to trigger an alarm).
        3.  Compare the `expectedAlarmCode` with the `actualAlarmCodeVector`. If they are identical, this candidate set `F` is a valid explanation for the observed alarms. Store this `F`.

4.  **Output Determination:**
    *   After checking all relevant candidate scenarios, we will have a list of `matchingScenarios`.
    *   If `matchingScenarios` contains exactly one scenario, it's the unambiguous solution. Output the link IDs from that scenario, separated by a space if there are two.
    *   Otherwise (if `matchingScenarios` is empty or contains more than one scenario), the failure cannot be unambiguously identified. Output "AMBIGUOUS".

**Example Trace (from problem description):**
Input:
```
5
3
1
010
100
101
110
010
111
```
`links = 5`, `mtrails = 3`, `failures = 1`
`actualAlarmCode = [false, true, false]` (from "010")

`linkCodeMatrix` (converted to booleans):
```
    m0    m1    m2
l0: true  false false
l1: true  false true
l2: true  true  false
l3: false true  false
l4: true  true  true
```

Since `failures = 1`, we only check single link failures:

*   **Candidate {0} (l0 fails):** `l0` affects `m0`. Expected: `[true, false, false]`. Does not match `actualAlarmCode`.
*   **Candidate {1} (l1 fails):** `l1` affects `m0`, `m2`. Expected: `[true, false, true]`. Does not match.
*   **Candidate {2} (l2 fails):** `l2` affects `m0`, `m1`. Expected: `[true, true, false]`. Does not match.
*   **Candidate {3} (l3 fails):** `l3` affects `m1`. Expected: `[false, true, false]`. **MATCH!** Add `{3}` to `matchingScenarios`.
*   **Candidate {4} (l4 fails):** `l4` affects `m0`, `m1`, `m2`. Expected: `[true, true, true]`. Does not match.

`matchingScenarios` contains `[[3]]`.
Since `matchingScenarios.length` is 1, output `3`.

**Complexity:**
*   Generating single link candidates: `links` combinations.
*   Generating dual link candidates: `links * (links - 1) / 2` combinations.
*   For each candidate, `mtrails` operations to calculate expected alarms.
*   Total operations: Approximately `(links + links^2 / 2) * mtrails`.
*   Given `links <= 90` and `mtrails <= 20`: `(90 + 90*89/2) * 20` = `(90 + 4005) * 20` = `4095 * 20` = `81900`. This is well within typical time limits (usually 10^7-10^8 operations per second).
