The problem asks us to calculate the intersection area of two disks, given their center coordinates (x, y) and radius (r). The result must be rounded to two decimal places. A crucial detail is that if the disks do not intersect, or if they intersect at exactly one point (i.e., they are tangent), the area is considered to be `0.00`.

Let the two disks be D1 with center (x1, y1) and radius r1, and D2 with center (x2, y2) and radius r2.

**1. Calculate the Distance Between Centers (d):**
The distance `d` between the centers (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:
`d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`

**2. Handle Special Cases:**
We need to consider various scenarios based on the relationship between `d`, `r1`, and `r2`. A small `EPSILON` value (e.g., `1e-9`) is used for floating-point comparisons to account for precision errors.

*   **Case A: No Intersection or External Tangency**
    If `d` is greater than or equal to the sum of the radii (`r1 + r2`), the disks either do not overlap at all, or they touch externally at exactly one point.
    According to the problem statement ("If these disks do not intersect, or intersect in one point, then the area is 0.00"), the intersection area in this case is `0.00`.
    Condition: `d >= r1 + r2 - EPSILON`

*   **Case B: One Disk Contains the Other (or Internal Tangency)**
    If `d` is less than or equal to the absolute difference of the radii (`|r1 - r2|`), one disk is entirely contained within the other, or they touch internally at exactly one point.
    Condition: `d <= Math.abs(r1 - r2) + EPSILON`
    Within this case, we have two sub-cases:
    *   **Sub-case B1: Internal Tangency**
        If `d` is very close to `|r1 - r2|`, the disks are internally tangent. As per the problem statement, if they "intersect in one point", the area is `0.00`.
        Condition: `Math.abs(d - Math.abs(r1 - r2)) < EPSILON`
        Area: `0.00`
    *   **Sub-case B2: Full Containment (Not Tangent)**
        If `d` is strictly less than `|r1 - r2|`, one disk is completely inside the other without touching the boundary at a single point. The intersection area is simply the area of the smaller disk.
        Area: `Math.PI * Math.min(r1, r2)^2`

*   **Case C: Partial Overlap**
    If `Math.abs(r1 - r2) < d < r1 + r2`, the disks partially overlap, intersecting at two distinct points. This is the general case requiring a formula for the area of intersection.
    The intersection area can be calculated as the sum of the areas of two circular segments.
    The formula for the area of a circular segment is `r^2 * arccos(h/r) - h * sqrt(r^2 - h^2)`, where `r` is the radius of the circle, and `h` is the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord.

    For disk 1, the chord is the common chord formed by the intersection. The distance `h1` from the center of disk 1 to this chord is:
    `h1 = (d^2 + r1^2 - r2^2) / (2 * d)`
    Similarly, for disk 2, the distance `h2` is:
    `h2 = (d^2 + r2^2 - r1^2) / (2 * d)`

    The arguments for `Math.acos` are `h1/r1` and `h2/r2`. Due to potential floating-point inaccuracies, these arguments should be clamped to the valid range `[-1, 1]` before calling `Math.acos`.

    The total intersection area is `(r1^2 * Math.acos(h1/r1) - h1 * Math.sqrt(r1^2 - h1^2)) + (r2^2 * Math.acos(h2/r2) - h2 * Math.sqrt(r2^2 - h2^2))`.

**3. Output Formatting:**
The final calculated `intersectionArea` must be rounded to two decimal places using `toFixed(2)`.
