The puzzle asks us to compute the product of a sequence of permutations, apply them from right to left, and output the result as a product of disjoint cycles, sorted lexicographically. The numbers involved are bells from 1 to 5.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Parsing the Input:**
    The input is a string like `(1 2)(3 4)(1 4)`. We need to extract each cycle into an array of numbers. For example, `(1 2 3)` would become `[1, 2, 3]`. Regular expressions are suitable for this.

2.  **Representing Permutations:**
    Since the bell numbers are small (1 to 5), we can represent any permutation as an array, say `mapping`, where `mapping[i]` indicates what bell `i` maps to. An identity permutation (where `i` maps to `i`) would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (index 0 is unused for convenience).

3.  **Composing Permutations (Right to Left):**
    The core of the problem is applying permutations correctly. If we have a sequence `P1 P2 P3`, it means apply `P3` first, then `P2`, then `P1`. This is standard function composition: `P1(P2(P3(x)))`.

    We'll maintain a `currentPermutation` array, initially set to the identity. We iterate through the parsed input cycles from right to left (i.e., `P_n`, then `P_{n-1}`, ..., then `P_1`). For each `nextCycle` (e.g., `P_k`):
    *   First, convert `nextCycle` into its own `nextCycleMapping` array.
    *   Then, compose `currentPermutation` with `nextCycleMapping`. The rule for `newPermutation(x) = nextCycleMapping(currentPermutation(x))` is applied. This means `newPermutation[bell] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[bell]]` for each `bell`.
    *   Update `currentPermutation` to this `newPermutation`.

    After processing all input cycles, `currentPermutation` will hold the final, combined permutation.

4.  **Decomposing into Disjoint Cycles:**
    Once we have the final `currentPermutation` mapping (e.g., `1->3, 2->1, 3->2`), we need to express it as a product of disjoint cycles.
    *   We use a `visited` array to keep track of bells already assigned to a cycle.
    *   Iterate through each bell `i` from 1 to `MAX_BELL`.
    *   If `i` has not been visited, it starts a new cycle:
        *   Begin tracing the path: `i -> currentPermutation[i] -> currentPermutation[currentPermutation[i]] -> ...`
        *   Add each bell to the current cycle and mark it as visited.
        *   Stop when we encounter a bell already visited (which will be the starting bell `i` in a properly formed cycle).
    *   Only include cycles that move elements (i.e., their length is greater than 1). A cycle like `(4)` (where 4 maps to 4) should be omitted.

5.  **Formatting the Output:**
    *   **Smallest element first in cycle:** For each disjoint cycle found (e.g., `[3, 2, 1]`), rotate its elements so that the smallest element is at the beginning (e.g., `[1, 3, 2]`).
    *   **Lexicographical sorting of cycles:** Sort the list of disjoint cycles based on their first element. Since each cycle now starts with its smallest element, this naturally achieves lexicographical order (e.g., `(1 4)(2 3)` comes before `(2 3)(1 4)` because `1 < 2`).
    *   **Handling Identity:** If no non-trivial cycles are found (meaning the permutation is the identity), print `()`. Otherwise, print each formatted cycle string, concatenated.

**Example: (1 2)(2 3)**

1.  **Parse:** `parsedCycles = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]`
2.  **Initial:** `currentPermutation = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (identity)
3.  **Composition (Right to Left):**
    *   **Process `[2, 3]` (rightmost):**
        *   `nextCycleMapping = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` (2 maps to 3, 3 maps to 2)
        *   `newPermutation[x] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[x]]`
            *   `newPermutation[1] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[1]] = nextCycleMapping[1] = 1`
            *   `newPermutation[2] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[2]] = nextCycleMapping[2] = 3`
            *   `newPermutation[3] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[3]] = nextCycleMapping[3] = 2`
        *   `currentPermutation` becomes `[0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` (equivalent to `(2 3)`)
    *   **Process `[1, 2]` (leftmost):**
        *   `nextCycleMapping = [0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` (1 maps to 2, 2 maps to 1)
        *   `newPermutation[x] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[x]]`
            *   `newPermutation[1] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[1]] = nextCycleMapping[1] = 2` (1 -> 1 by current, then 1 -> 2 by next)
            *   `newPermutation[2] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[2]] = nextCycleMapping[3] = 3` (2 -> 3 by current, then 3 -> 3 by next)
            *   `newPermutation[3] = nextCycleMapping[currentPermutation[3]] = nextCycleMapping[2] = 1` (3 -> 2 by current, then 2 -> 1 by next)
        *   `currentPermutation` becomes `[0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`
4.  **Decompose:**
    *   `i = 1`: Not visited. Cycle: `1 -> currentPermutation[1]=2 -> currentPermutation[2]=3 -> currentPermutation[3]=1`. Cycle `[1, 2, 3]`. Mark 1, 2, 3 visited.
    *   `i = 2, 3`: Visited.
    *   `i = 4`: Not visited. `4 -> currentPermutation[4]=4`. 1-cycle `[4]`. Skip.
    *   `i = 5`: Not visited. `5 -> currentPermutation[5]=5`. 1-cycle `[5]`. Skip.
    *   `resultCycles = [[1, 2, 3]]`
5.  **Format:**
    *   `[1, 2, 3]` already starts with smallest element.
    *   Only one cycle, no sorting needed.
    *   Output: `(1 2 3)`

This matches the example output.
