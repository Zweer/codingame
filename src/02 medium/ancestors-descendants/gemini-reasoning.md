The puzzle asks us to process a list of family members, each specified by their name and a number of leading dots indicating their hierarchical level. The core rule is that a person with `k` dots is a child of the most recently mentioned person with `k-1` dots. We need to output "descent paths", which are essentially chains of ancestors leading to a "leaf" descendant in the input sequence.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Representing Current Ancestry:** The "most recently mentioned ancestor" rule strongly suggests a dynamic structure. An array, let's call it `currentAncestors`, can effectively serve this purpose. `currentAncestors[level]` will store the name of the current active ancestor at that specific `level` (number of dots). The length of this array will represent the current depth of the active family branch.

2.  **Processing Each Family Member:**
    *   For each input line, we first parse the `level` (number of leading dots) and the `name`.
    *   **Determining Path Completion:** When we encounter a new person, we need to decide if the *previous* active path (the one ending with `currentAncestors[currentAncestors.length - 1]`) is now complete. This happens if the new person's `level` is less than or equal to the deepest `level` of the currently active path.
        *   If `level_new <= currentAncestors.length - 1`: It means the person at `currentAncestors[currentAncestors.length - 1]` (and potentially their ancestors in the active path) no longer has children following them in the input sequence (or their remaining children are represented by siblings at a higher level). Thus, the path leading to `currentAncestors[currentAncestors.length - 1]` is complete and should be printed.
        *   After printing, we must "prune" `currentAncestors`. The new person dictates the active branch. Any ancestors deeper than `level_new` are no longer relevant for the current branch. So, `currentAncestors` is truncated to `level_new` elements.
    *   **Adding Current Person to Ancestry:** After handling path completion for previous entries, the current person `name` is added to `currentAncestors` at their `level`. `currentAncestors[level] = name`. The array's length is then set to `level + 1` to ensure it only contains relevant ancestors for the current branch.

3.  **Handling Remaining Paths:** After processing all input lines, there might be one last active path remaining in `currentAncestors` (e.g., the `h` in the example, or the last branch in general). This path must also be printed.

**Example Walkthrough (from the puzzle):**

Input:
```
a
.b
..c
d
.e
..f
.g
h
```

`currentAncestors = []`, `outputBuffer = []`

1.  **`a` (level 0):**
    *   No active path to complete.
    *   `currentAncestors[0] = "a"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["a"]`.

2.  **`.b` (level 1):**
    *   `level` (1) > `currentAncestors.length - 1` (0). No path completion.
    *   `currentAncestors[1] = "b"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["a", "b"]`.

3.  **`..c` (level 2):**
    *   `level` (2) > `currentAncestors.length - 1` (1). No path completion.
    *   `currentAncestors[2] = "c"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["a", "b", "c"]`.

4.  **`d` (level 0):**
    *   `currentAncestors.length` is 3, `level` is 0. `level <= currentAncestors.length - 1` (0 <= 2) is true.
    *   Print `currentAncestors.slice().join(" > ")` which is `["a", "b", "c"].join(" > ")` -> `"a > b > c"`. Add to `outputBuffer`.
    *   `currentAncestors.length = 0`. `currentAncestors` becomes `[]`.
    *   `currentAncestors[0] = "d"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["d"]`.

5.  **`.e` (level 1):**
    *   `level` (1) > `currentAncestors.length - 1` (0). No path completion.
    *   `currentAncestors[1] = "e"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["d", "e"]`.

6.  **`..f` (level 2):**
    *   `level` (2) > `currentAncestors.length - 1` (1). No path completion.
    *   `currentAncestors[2] = "f"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["d", "e", "f"]`.

7.  **`.g` (level 1):**
    *   `currentAncestors.length` is 3, `level` is 1. `level <= currentAncestors.length - 1` (1 <= 2) is true.
    *   Print `currentAncestors.slice().join(" > ")` which is `["d", "e", "f"].join(" > ")` -> `"d > e > f"`. Add to `outputBuffer`.
    *   `currentAncestors.length = 1`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["d"]`.
    *   `currentAncestors[1] = "g"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["d", "g"]`.

8.  **`h` (level 0):**
    *   `currentAncestors.length` is 2, `level` is 0. `level <= currentAncestors.length - 1` (0 <= 1) is true.
    *   Print `currentAncestors.slice().join(" > ")` which is `["d", "g"].join(" > ")` -> `"d > g"`. Add to `outputBuffer`.
    *   `currentAncestors.length = 0`. `currentAncestors` becomes `[]`.
    *   `currentAncestors[0] = "h"`. `currentAncestors` becomes `["h"]`.

**End of Input Loop:**
*   `currentAncestors` is `["h"]`. Its length is > 0.
*   Print `currentAncestors.join(" > ")` -> `"h"`. Add to `outputBuffer`.

**Final Output:**
The `outputBuffer` now contains:
```
a > b > c
d > e > f
d > g
h
```
This matches the expected output.

**Code Structure:**
The code will read `N`, then loop `N` times. Inside the loop, it will parse each line to get the level and name. It will implement the logic described above to manage the `currentAncestors` array and `outputBuffer`. Finally, it will print the contents of `outputBuffer`.
