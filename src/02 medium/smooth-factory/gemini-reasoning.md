The problem asks us to find the total number of fruits Edsger needs to schedule to ensure Ming and Ham achieve `V` victories. The key constraints are:
1. The total number of fruits should be as little as possible.
2. No two shipments can be the same size.

The game "Smoothie Reduction" states that a victory occurs if the second row ever gets reduced to a single watermelon. This means the number of fruits becomes `1`, and the last operation was using a watermelon (`n=1`).

Let's analyze the fruit reduction rules:
- Apples: `n = 2`
- Oranges: `n = 3`
- Bananas: `n = 5`
- Watermelons: `n = 1`

A turn involves reducing `X` fruits to `X/n` fruits, provided `X` is perfectly divisible by `n`. If not, it's a defeat. To achieve a victory, the game must end with `1` fruit after a watermelon reduction. This implies that the initial number of fruits `S` must be reducible to `1` by a sequence of valid `n` values (1, 2, 3, or 5).

This means `S` must be a number that can be formed by multiplying `1` by any combination of factors 1, 2, 3, and 5. In other words, `S` must be of the form `2^a * 3^b * 5^c` for non-negative integers `a, b, c`. These numbers are known as 5-smooth numbers or Hamming numbers (if considering primes up to 5). Examples include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, etc.

To minimize the total fruit, Edsger must schedule the `V` smallest unique shipment sizes that result in a victory. This means we need to find the `V` smallest numbers of the form `2^a * 3^b * 5^c` and sum them up.

**Algorithm:**
We can generate these 5-smooth numbers efficiently using a three-pointer approach:
1. Initialize an array `hammingNumbers` with the first 5-smooth number, which is `1`.
2. Initialize three pointers `i2, i3, i5` to `0`. These pointers will track the indices in `hammingNumbers` whose values, when multiplied by 2, 3, or 5 respectively, could generate the next 5-smooth number.
3. Initialize `totalFruitScheduled` to `1`.
4. Loop `V-1` times (since we already have the first number `1`):
    a. Calculate the next potential 5-smooth numbers: `next2 = hammingNumbers[i2] * 2`, `next3 = hammingNumbers[i3] * 3`, `next5 = hammingNumbers[i5] * 5`.
    b. The true next 5-smooth number (`nextHamming`) is the minimum of these three.
    c. Add `nextHamming` to `hammingNumbers` and to `totalFruitScheduled`.
    d. Increment the pointer(s) that produced `nextHamming`. It's crucial to increment all pointers that match `nextHamming` (e.g., if `next2` and `next3` are both `6`, increment both `i2` and `i3`) to ensure uniqueness and correctness.

This approach guarantees that the numbers are generated in increasing order and without duplicates. The maximum value of `V` is 4500. The 4500th 5-smooth number and their sum will fit within JavaScript's standard `number` type (which uses 64-bit floating point and can accurately represent integers up to 2^53 - 1).

**Example Trace (V=5):**
1. `hammingNumbers = [1]`, `i2=0, i3=0, i5=0`, `totalFruitScheduled = 1`.
2. **k=1 (2nd number):**
   `next2 = 1*2 = 2`
   `next3 = 1*3 = 3`
   `next5 = 1*5 = 5`
   `nextHamming = min(2,3,5) = 2`.
   `hammingNumbers.push(2) -> [1, 2]`. `totalFruitScheduled += 2 -> 3`.
   `i2++` (since `2 === next2`) `-> i2=1`.
3. **k=2 (3rd number):**
   `next2 = 2*2 = 4`
   `next3 = 1*3 = 3`
   `next5 = 1*5 = 5`
   `nextHamming = min(4,3,5) = 3`.
   `hammingNumbers.push(3) -> [1, 2, 3]`. `totalFruitScheduled += 3 -> 6`.
   `i3++` (since `3 === next3`) `-> i3=1`.
4. **k=3 (4th number):**
   `next2 = 2*2 = 4`
   `next3 = 2*3 = 6`
   `next5 = 1*5 = 5`
   `nextHamming = min(4,6,5) = 4`.
   `hammingNumbers.push(4) -> [1, 2, 3, 4]`. `totalFruitScheduled += 4 -> 10`.
   `i2++` (since `4 === next2`) `-> i2=2`.
5. **k=4 (5th number):**
   `next2 = 3*2 = 6`
   `next3 = 2*3 = 6`
   `next5 = 1*5 = 5`
   `nextHamming = min(6,6,5) = 5`.
   `hammingNumbers.push(5) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. `totalFruitScheduled += 5 -> 15`.
   `i5++` (since `5 === next5`) `-> i5=1`.

The loop finishes. The total is `15`, matching the example.
