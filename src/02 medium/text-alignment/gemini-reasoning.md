The puzzle requires us to align a given text based on a specified alignment type (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CENTER`, `JUSTIFY`) to the width of the longest line in the text. There are specific rules regarding trailing whitespace for `LEFT` and `CENTER` alignments.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Read Input**:
    *   Read the alignment type (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CENTER`, `JUSTIFY`).
    *   Read the number of text lines (`N`).
    *   Read all `N` text lines into an array.

2.  **Determine Maximum Width**:
    *   While reading the lines, keep track of the maximum line length encountered. This `maxWidth` will be the target width for alignment.

3.  **Process Each Line**:
    *   Iterate through each line in the stored array.
    *   For each `currentLine`, calculate `paddingNeeded = maxWidth - currentLine.length`. This represents the total number of additional spaces needed to reach `maxWidth`.

4.  **Apply Alignment Logic**:

    *   **LEFT**:
        *   The problem statement specifies "display text as-is" and "Do NOT print trailing whitespace". This means we simply print the line without adding any padding. The conceptual `maxWidth` serves as a reference for other alignment types.

    *   **RIGHT**:
        *   Pad `paddingNeeded` spaces to the left of the `currentLine`.

    *   **CENTER**:
        *   Calculate `leftSpaces = Math.floor(paddingNeeded / 2)`.
        *   The problem states "If the number of remaining spaces is odd, leave the extra space on the right. Don't actually append space characters to the end of the line, though." This means we only add `leftSpaces` to the left of the `currentLine`. Any conceptual "right padding" is not printed.

    *   **JUSTIFY**:
        *   Split the `currentLine` into `words` using space as a delimiter.
        *   **Single Word Line**: If `words.length` is 1, the line remains left-aligned, so print it as-is (similar to `LEFT`).
        *   **Multiple Words Line**:
            *   Calculate `numGaps = words.length - 1`.
            *   The `paddingNeeded` spaces are *additional* spaces to be distributed *between* the words. Each gap already contains one space.
            *   Calculate `baseAdditionalSpacesPerGap = Math.floor(paddingNeeded / numGaps)`.
            *   Calculate `remainingExtraSpaces = paddingNeeded % numGaps`. These extra spaces will be distributed one by one to the first `remainingExtraSpaces` gaps from left to right.
            *   Construct the `justifiedLine`: Start with the first word. For each subsequent word, append `(1 + currentAdditionalSpaces)` spaces, then the word. `currentAdditionalSpaces` will be `baseAdditionalSpacesPerGap`, potentially incremented by 1 if `remainingExtraSpaces` allows. This ensures all justified lines end on the same column (`maxWidth`).

**Example for JUSTIFY (from problem description):**
"spread 11 spaces between 5 words" (`W1 W2 W3 W4 W5`)
`paddingNeeded = 11`. `numWords = 5`, `numGaps = 4`.
`baseAdditionalSpacesPerGap = Math.floor(11 / 4) = 2`.
`remainingExtraSpaces = 11 % 4 = 3`.

The distribution of additional spaces will be:
*   Gap 1 (after W1): `2 + 1 = 3` additional spaces. Total spaces = `1 + 3 = 4`.
*   Gap 2 (after W2): `2 + 1 = 3` additional spaces. Total spaces = `1 + 3 = 4`.
*   Gap 3 (after W3): `2 + 1 = 3` additional spaces. Total spaces = `1 + 3 = 4`.
*   Gap 4 (after W4): `2 + 0 = 2` additional spaces. Total spaces = `1 + 2 = 3`.

This results in the sequence of spaces `4, 4, 4, 3` between words, ensuring the total length matches `maxWidth`.
