The problem asks us to validate if a given `text` string matches a `format` string, which uses special wildcard characters similar to SQL's LIKE operator.

Here's a breakdown of the rules:
1.  `?`: Matches exactly one character.
2.  `~`: Matches any number of characters (zero or more).
3.  Any other character: Matches exactly that character.
4.  The match must be from start to end of both `text` and `format`.

This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming. We can define a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if the first `i` characters of `text` match the first `j` characters of `format`, and `false` otherwise.

Let `N` be the length of `text` and `M` be the length of `format`. The `dp` table will have dimensions `(N+1) x (M+1)`.

**Initialization:**

*   `dp[0][0] = true`: An empty `text` matches an empty `format`. This is our base case.
*   For the first row (`i=0`), meaning `text` is empty:
    *   `dp[0][j]` can only be `true` if `format[0...j-1]` consists entirely of `~` characters. We can fill this by checking: `dp[0][j] = (format[j-1] === '~' && dp[0][j-1])`.

**Transitions (Filling the `dp` table):**

We iterate `i` from 1 to `N` (for `text` characters) and `j` from 1 to `M` (for `format` characters). For each `dp[i][j]`, we consider `text[i-1]` (the `i`-th character of `text`) and `format[j-1]` (the `j`-th character of `format`).

1.  **If `format[j-1]` is `?`:**
    *   The `?` matches exactly one character (`text[i-1]`).
    *   So, `dp[i][j]` is `true` if `text[0...i-2]` matched `format[0...j-2]`.
    *   `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`

2.  **If `format[j-1]` is `~`:**
    *   The `~` can match zero characters OR one or more characters.
    *   **Case 1: `~` matches zero characters.** This means `text[0...i-1]` must match `format[0...j-2]`. This corresponds to `dp[i][j-1]`.
    *   **Case 2: `~` matches `text[i-1]` (and potentially more characters before it).** This means `text[0...i-2]` must match `format[0...j-1]`, where the `~` at `format[j-1]` continues to absorb `text[i-1]`. This corresponds to `dp[i-1][j]`.
    *   So, `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] || dp[i-1][j]`

3.  **If `format[j-1]` is a literal character (any other character):**
    *   The `format` character must exactly match `text[i-1]`.
    *   Additionally, the preceding parts must also match: `text[0...i-2]` must match `format[0...j-2]`.
    *   `dp[i][j] = (text[i-1] === format[j-1]) && dp[i-1][j-1]`

**Result:**

After filling the entire `dp` table, `dp[N][M]` will contain the final result. If it's `true`, the `text` matches the `format`; otherwise, it doesn't.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N\*M), as we fill an N x M table with constant time operations for each cell. Given N < 1000 and M < 100, this is approximately 100,000 operations, which is very efficient.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N\*M) for the `dp` table.
