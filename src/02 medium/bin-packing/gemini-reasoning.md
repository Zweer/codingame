The problem asks whether a given set of items with specific weights can be distributed *evenly* among a fixed number of identical bins. "Evenly" means that every bin must end up with the exact same total weight, and each item must be placed entirely in one bin. We need to output "yes" if such a distribution is possible, and "no" otherwise.

This is a variation of the multiway partition problem, often referred to as the `k`-partition problem or exact partition problem. Since the weights must be distributed *evenly*, a crucial pre-condition is that the total weight of all items must be perfectly divisible by the number of bins. If `sum(weights) % b != 0`, it's impossible, and we can immediately say "no". Otherwise, the target weight for each bin will be `targetWeight = sum(weights) / b`.

The problem then transforms into finding if we can partition the items into `b` subsets, each summing up to `targetWeight`. This is a known NP-hard problem in general. However, the given constraints (`b` up to 6, `m` up to 20) are relatively small, suggesting that an exponential time complexity solution (e.g., backtracking with memoization) might be acceptable.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Read Input and Pre-checks:**
    *   For each test case, read `b`, `m`, and the `weights` array.
    *   Calculate `totalWeight = sum(weights)`.
    *   If `totalWeight % b != 0`, print "no" and move to the next test case.
    *   Calculate `targetWeightPerBin = totalWeight / b`.
    *   **Optimization:** Check if any single item `w` in `weights` is greater than `targetWeightPerBin`. If so, it's impossible to place this item without exceeding a bin's target weight, so print "no" and move to the next test case.

2.  **Sort Weights (Optimization):**
    *   Sort the `weights` array in *descending* order. This is a common heuristic for partition problems. By attempting to place larger items first, we tend to hit dead ends (bins overflowing) faster, which helps prune the search space more effectively.

3.  **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization:**
    *   Define a recursive function, say `canPartition(itemIndex, currentBinWeights)`, where:
        *   `itemIndex`: The index of the item currently being considered for placement (from `0` to `m-1`).
        *   `currentBinWeights`: An array of `b` numbers, where `currentBinWeights[j]` stores the current total weight accumulated in bin `j`.
    *   **Base Case:** If `itemIndex === m` (all items have been placed), it means we successfully distributed all items. Return `true`.
    *   **Memoization:**
        *   To avoid recomputing the same subproblems, use a `Map` (or similar data structure) for memoization.
        *   The state for memoization needs to be unique and canonical. Since the `b` bins are identical, the order of weights within `currentBinWeights` doesn't matter. Sort a *copy* of `currentBinWeights` to create a canonical key (e.g., `itemIndex + '-' + sortedBinWeights.join(',')`).
        *   Before computing, check if the `stateKey` exists in the memo. If yes, return the stored result.
    *   **Recursive Step:**
        *   Get the `currentItemWeight = weights[itemIndex]`.
        *   Iterate through each bin `binIdx` from `0` to `b-1`:
            *   If placing `currentItemWeight` into `binIdx` would not exceed `targetWeightPerBin` (i.e., `currentBinWeights[binIdx] + currentItemWeight <= targetWeightPerBin`):
                *   Create a *new array* `nextBinWeights` by copying `currentBinWeights`.
                *   Add `currentItemWeight` to `nextBinWeights[binIdx]`.
                *   Recursively call `canPartition(itemIndex + 1, nextBinWeights)`.
                *   If the recursive call returns `true`, it means a solution was found down this path. Store `true` in the memo for the current `stateKey` and return `true`.
        *   If the loop finishes and no placement leads to a solution, it means no path from the current state can achieve an even distribution. Store `false` in the memo for the current `stateKey` and return `false`.
    *   **Initial Call:** Start the process by calling `canPartition(0, Array(b).fill(0))` (starting with the first item and all bins empty).
    *   Print "yes" or "no" based on the result of the initial call.

**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The number of `itemIndex` states is `m` (up to 20).
    *   The number of `currentBinWeights` states: This is the dominant factor. Each bin's weight can go up to `targetWeightPerBin`. The total sum of weights in `currentBinWeights` for a given `itemIndex` is the sum of items already placed. While the theoretical worst-case (number of partitions of an integer) can be large, the practical constraints and the pruning (sorting items, memoization) significantly reduce the actual explored states. For `b <= 6` and `m <= 20`, this approach is generally efficient enough for competitive programming.
    *   Inside each recursive call, we iterate `b` times. Sorting the `currentBinWeights` for the key takes `O(b log b)`. Copying the array takes `O(b)`.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The `memo` map stores states. The number of states can be significant but is often within limits. Each key is a string representing `itemIndex` and `b` numbers. The depth of the recursion stack is `m`.

The constraints `b <= 6` and `m <= 20` are typical for problems that can be solved with a state-space search algorithm like this, where `b` is a small base for the exponential complexity.
