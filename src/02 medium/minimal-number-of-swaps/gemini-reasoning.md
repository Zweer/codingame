The problem asks for the minimum number of swaps to group all `1`s at the beginning of a list of `0`s and `1`s. This means the final desired arrangement will consist of all `1`s first, followed by all `0`s. For example, if the input is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`, and there are three `1`s, the target state is `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.

**Understanding the Goal:**
Let `k` be the total number of `1`s in the given list. In the sorted configuration, the first `k` positions must contain `1`s, and the remaining `N-k` positions must contain `0`s.

**Minimum Swaps Logic:**
Consider the first `k` positions of the *original* list. These are the positions where `1`s are supposed to be in the final arrangement.
Any `0` found within these first `k` positions is "out of place" because it should be a `1`.
Similarly, any `1` found in the remaining `N-k` positions (after the first `k` positions) is also "out of place" because it should be a `0`.

The key insight is that for every `0` that is in the "1s section" (the first `k` positions), there *must* be a corresponding `1` in the "0s section" (the remaining `N-k` positions). This is because the total count of `1`s and `0`s remains constant. If a `0` is occupying a spot meant for a `1`, then a `1` must be occupying a spot meant for a `0` elsewhere.

Each swap involves two elements at different positions. If we swap a `0` from the "1s section" with a `1` from the "0s section", both elements move to their correct final type of partition. For example, if `list[i] = 0` (where `i < k`) and `list[j] = 1` (where `j >= k`), swapping them places a `1` at `list[i]` (correct for the "1s section") and a `0` at `list[j]` (correct for the "0s section"). This single swap fixes two misplaced elements.

Since each such swap correctly places two elements, and we want the *minimum* number of swaps, we should perform exactly these types of swaps. The minimum number of swaps is therefore equal to the count of `0`s found in the first `k` positions of the original list. (This is also equivalent to the count of `1`s found in the last `N-k` positions).

**Algorithm:**
1.  **Count `1`s:** Iterate through the entire input list to determine `numOnes`, the total count of `1`s. This `numOnes` value defines the boundary: the first `numOnes` elements *should* be `1`s.
2.  **Count Misplaced `0`s:** Iterate through the first `numOnes` positions of the original list. For each position `i` from `0` to `numOnes - 1`, if `list[i]` is `0`, increment a `swaps` counter.
3.  **Output:** The final value of `swaps` is the minimum number of steps required.

**Example Walkthrough (Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`):**
1.  `N = 5`, `list = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
2.  **Count `1`s:**
    *   `list[0] = 1`
    *   `list[1] = 0`
    *   `list[2] = 1`
    *   `list[3] = 0`
    *   `list[4] = 1`
    Total `numOnes = 3`.
3.  **Count Misplaced `0`s:** The target `1`s section is `list[0]`, `list[1]`, `list[2]`.
    *   `i = 0`: `list[0] = 1`. No swap needed.
    *   `i = 1`: `list[1] = 0`. This `0` is in the `1`s section. Increment `swaps`. `swaps = 1`.
    *   `i = 2`: `list[2] = 1`. No swap needed.
    Loop ends. `swaps = 1`.
4.  **Output:** `1`.

This approach is efficient, running in O(N) time complexity, which is well within the constraints (N < 500).
