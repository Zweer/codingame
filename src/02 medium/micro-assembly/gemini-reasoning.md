The puzzle requires implementing a simple assembly interpreter. The solution involves parsing the initial register values, then parsing each assembly instruction into a structured format, and finally executing these instructions in a loop, handling jumps as necessary.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Input Parsing:**
    *   The first line provides the initial integer values for registers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. These are read, split by spaces, and parsed into a TypeScript object or map representing the registers.
    *   The second line gives the number `n` of subsequent instructions.
    *   The following `n` lines are the assembly instructions. Each instruction string is parsed into a structured object (e.g., specifying its type like `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JNE`, and its specific operands). Pre-parsing all instructions into an array simplifies the main execution loop.

2.  **Data Structures:**
    *   **Registers:** A simple JavaScript object `{ a: number, b: number, c: number, d: number }` is used to store the current values of the registers.
    *   **Instructions:** An array of TypeScript interface-defined objects is used. This allows for strong typing of each instruction type's specific parameters (e.g., `MOV` has `dest` and `src`, while `ADD` has `dest`, `src1`, `src2`).
    *   **Operands:** A custom type `OperandValue` is defined to represent values that can either be a register name (string like 'a') or an immediate integer (number).

3.  **Core Logic - `getOperandValue` Helper:**
    *   A crucial helper function `getOperandValue(operand: OperandValue)` is created. This function takes an `OperandValue` (which could be a register name string or a direct number) and returns its actual numeric value. If it's a register name, it looks up the current value in the `registers` object; otherwise, it returns the number directly.

4.  **Interpreter Execution Loop:**
    *   An `instructionPointer` variable (`ip`) tracks the current instruction line, starting at 0.
    *   The interpreter enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `ip` is a valid index within the `instructions` array.
    *   Inside the loop, the current instruction is fetched based on `ip`.
    *   A `switch` statement on the instruction's `type` determines which operation to perform:
        *   **MOV:** Assigns the `src` value (resolved using `getOperandValue`) to the `dest` register.
        *   **ADD:** Adds `src1` and `src2` values (resolved using `getOperandValue`) and stores the sum in the `dest` register.
        *   **SUB:** Subtracts `src2` value from `src1` value (both resolved) and stores the result in the `dest` register.
        *   **JNE:** Compares `src1` and `src2` values. If they are not equal, the `instructionPointer` is directly set to the `jumpTarget` specified in the instruction. If they are equal, execution proceeds to the next instruction naturally.
    *   For `MOV`, `ADD`, and `SUB`, the `ip` is incremented by 1 to move to the next instruction. For `JNE`, `ip` is either set to the jump target or incremented, depending on the condition.

5.  **Output:**
    *   After the loop finishes (meaning all instructions have been processed or a jump went out of bounds, which won't happen given the problem constraints), the final values of registers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are printed, separated by spaces.

**TypeScript Considerations:**
*   Type aliases (`RegisterName`, `OperandValue`) and interfaces (`InstructionBase`, `MovInstruction`, etc.) are used to ensure type safety and improve code readability, making the structure of instructions explicit.
*   Type guards (`typeof operand === 'string'`) are implicitly handled by the `getOperandValue` function.
