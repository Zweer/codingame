The problem asks us to perfectly tile a given grid shape using a set of provided polyominoes. Each polyomino can be rotated by multiples of 90 degrees and flipped horizontally or vertically, resulting in up to 8 unique orientations for each piece. This is a classic exact cover problem, often solved using a backtracking algorithm, similar to Knuth's Algorithm X or Dancing Links. Given the constraints (max 14 pieces, board up to 19x19), a well-optimized backtracking search should suffice within the 5-second time limit.

Here's a breakdown of the solution approach:

1.  **Polyomino Representation:**
    *   Each polyomino shape is defined as a list of relative coordinates `(r, c)` representing its occupied cells. The coordinates are normalized so that the top-most, left-most cell of the piece is at `(0,0)` in its base orientation.
    *   We manually define these coordinates for all polyominoes 'A' through 'N' based on the provided image, paying close attention to the exact shapes, as some are custom and not standard polyominoes.

2.  **Generate All Orientations:**
    *   For each base polyomino shape, we systematically generate all its unique orientations. This involves:
        *   **Rotations:** Applying 90-degree clockwise rotations four times (0째, 90째, 180째, 270째). A rotation `(r, c)` becomes `(c, -r)`.
        *   **Flips:** For each rotated shape, we generate its horizontal flip. A horizontal flip `(r, c)` becomes `(r, -c)`. (Note: a vertical flip combined with rotations would produce redundant shapes already covered by horizontal flips and rotations).
    *   After each rotation or flip, the resulting shape is `normalized` (shifted so its top-leftmost occupied cell is again at `(0,0)`) and converted to a unique string representation. This allows us to store only truly unique orientations in a `Set` to avoid redundant computations.
    *   All unique orientations for all pieces are precomputed and stored in a `Map` for quick lookup during the search.

3.  **Backtracking Search (`solve` function):**
    *   The `solve` function is a recursive backtracking algorithm. It takes the list of piece IDs to place and the index of the current piece being considered.
    *   **State:** The board is represented as a global 2D array of characters, where 'O' denotes an empty cell that must be filled, and polyomino IDs (e.g., 'A', 'B') denote occupied cells. '.' denotes an empty cell that must remain empty.
    *   **Base Cases:**
        *   If a solution has already been found (due to the `solutionFound` flag), immediately return `true` to stop further search.
        *   If there are no 'O' cells left on the board, it means the board is completely filled. We then check if all pieces have been used (`currentPieceIndex === pieceIds.length`). If both conditions are met, a solution is found; we store a copy of the board and return `true`.
        *   If there are 'O' cells left but no pieces remaining to place (`currentPieceIndex === pieceIds.length`), this path is invalid; return `false`.
    *   **Recursive Step:**
        1.  **Find Next Empty Spot:** Find the top-most, left-most 'O' cell on the board. This is a common heuristic to guide the search and prune branches effectively.
        2.  **Iterate Through Pieces:** For the current piece (determined by `pieceIds[currentPieceIndex]`):
            *   **Iterate Through Orientations:** Try each precomputed unique orientation of the current piece.
            *   **Iterate Through Placements:** For each orientation, try all possible positions where it can cover the "next empty spot" found in step 1. This is done by calculating the `anchorR, anchorC` (the top-left corner of the piece's bounding box) such that one of the piece's cells aligns with the `nextR, nextC` empty spot.
            *   **`canPlace` Check:** Before placing, verify if the current piece orientation fits:
                *   All cells of the piece must be within board boundaries.
                *   All cells of the piece must cover an 'O' cell on the board (not a '.' or an already placed piece).
            *   **Place and Recurse:** If the placement is valid:
                *   Place the piece on the global `BOARD` (marking cells with its ID).
                *   Recursively call `solve` for the next piece (`currentPieceIndex + 1`).
                *   If the recursive call returns `true` (meaning a solution was found down that path), propagate `true` up the call stack.
                *   **Backtrack:** If the recursive call returns `false`, undo the placement (`unplacePiece`) on the `BOARD` to restore the state, allowing other placements to be tried.
    *   If no placement for the current piece leads to a solution, return `false`.

4.  **Input/Output:**
    *   Read the input polyomino IDs, board dimensions (`h`, `w`), and initial board configuration.
    *   Initialize the global `BOARD` and other variables.
    *   Call `precomputeAllOrientations()` once at the start.
    *   Sort the input `pieceIds` (optional, but can affect search order).
    *   Call `solve` to start the search.
    *   Print the `finalBoard` if a solution is found.

This approach effectively explores the search space using backtracking and pruning, which is suitable for exact cover problems within the given constraints.
