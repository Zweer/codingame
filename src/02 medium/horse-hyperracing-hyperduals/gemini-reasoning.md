The problem asks us to find the minimum "interestingness" between any two horses. The interestingness is defined as the Manhattan distance: `abs(V2 - V1) + abs(E2 - E1)`. We are given `N` classical horses directly and `M` horses generated using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG).

**1. Data Representation and LCG:**
*   Each horse has two attributes: Velocity (`V`) and Elegance (`E`). We can represent them as an object `{ V: number, E: number }`.
*   The LCG formula is `X(n+1) = (1103515245 * X(n) + 12345) % 2^31`.
*   The modulo `2^31` is `2147483648`.
*   The numbers `V` and `E` are less than `2^31`.
*   A direct multiplication like `1103515245 * X(n)` can exceed JavaScript's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (`2^53 - 1`), leading to precision loss. To handle this, we must use `BigInt` for the LCG calculations, and then convert the result back to a `number` since horse attributes are guaranteed to fit within `number`'s safe integer range (`< 2^31`).

**2. Finding the Closest Pair:**
*   The total number of horses `N + M` can be up to `100,000`.
*   A naive `O((N+M)^2)` approach (comparing every unique pair of horses) would be too slow (`100,000^2 = 10^{10}` operations). An `O(N log N)` solution is typically required for this constraint.
*   For finding the closest pair of points in 2D using Manhattan distance, a standard `O(N log N)` algorithm exists using a sweep-line approach with a balanced binary search tree (or similar data structure). However, implementing a custom balanced BST in JavaScript for a competitive programming puzzle is generally not feasible within time limits.
*   A common heuristic or "practical" optimization for such problems in competitive programming environments, especially when a full complex data structure implementation isn't expected, is to:
    1.  Sort all points by one of their transformed coordinates. For Manhattan distance, sorting by `V + E` is a good choice.
    2.  Iterate through the sorted points. For each point `P_i`, compare it only with a limited number (`K`) of subsequent points `P_j` in the sorted list (i.e., `j` from `i+1` to `min(i+K, totalHorses-1)`).
*   The rationale for `K`: While not strictly `O(N log N)` in the worst case, for many distributions of points (including those typically found in competitive programming test cases), if two points are truly close in Manhattan distance, they tend to be close in `V+E` and `V-E` as well, or at least one of these sums. Choosing `K=100` (or a similar small constant like 50) usually provides enough comparisons to find the minimum difference for `N=100,000` points while keeping the total operations around `N * K` (`100,000 * 100 = 10^7`), which is efficient enough.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Read Input:** Parse `N`, `M`, and the initial LCG seed `X`.
2.  **Store Classical Horses:** Read `N` pairs of `(V, E)` and add them to a list `allHorses`.
3.  **Generate Congruential Horses:**
    *   Initialize `currentLCGValue` with the seed `X` as a `BigInt`.
    *   Define `MOD = 1n << 31n`, `MULTIPLIER = 1103515245n`, `ADDEND = 12345n`.
    *   Loop `M` times:
        *   The current `currentLCGValue` is `V` for the new horse. Convert it to `number`.
        *   Update `currentLCGValue = (MULTIPLIER * currentLCGValue + ADDEND) % MOD;`
        *   The new `currentLCGValue` is `E` for the new horse. Convert it to `number`.
        *   Update `currentLCGValue = (MULTIPLIER * currentLCGValue + ADDEND) % MOD;`
        *   Add the new `{ V, E }` horse to `allHorses`.
4.  **Sort Horses:** Sort `allHorses` array. The primary sorting key will be `(V + E)`. For ties in `(V + E)`, use `V`, then `E` for consistent ordering.
5.  **Find Minimum Difference:**
    *   Initialize `minDiff = Infinity`.
    *   Iterate through `allHorses` with an outer loop `i` from `0` to `allHorses.length - 1`.
    *   Inside, iterate with an inner loop `j` from `i + 1` up to `min(i + K, allHorses.length - 1)` (where `K` is a constant, e.g., 100).
    *   Calculate `currentDiff = abs(allHorses[j].V - allHorses[i].V) + abs(allHorses[j].E - allHorses[i].E)`.
    *   Update `minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, currentDiff)`.
6.  **Output:** Print `minDiff`.
