The problem asks us to arrange 7 hexagonal depots on a floor plan, with one central depot and six surrounding it. Each depot has 6 walls with specific textures. We need to find the correct placement and rotation for each depot based on a set of rules and then output the right-wall texture for each depot in a specific order.

**Problem Breakdown and Strategy:**

1.  **Depot Representation:** Each depot is identified by its initial index (0-6) and has 6 wall textures. We can represent these walls as an array of characters. Rotation means cyclically shifting the elements of this array.
    *   Wall indices: 0 (Top), 1 (Top-Right/Right), 2 (Bottom-Right), 3 (Bottom), 4 (Bottom-Left), 5 (Top-Left).
    *   The "right" wall (for output and central depot orientation) is wall at index 1.

2.  **Layout Positions:** The output specifies a fixed arrangement of 7 depots, which we can map to internal layout positions (0-6):
    *   P0: Top-Left
    *   P1: Top-Right
    *   P2: Middle-Left
    *   P3: Center
    *   P4: Middle-Right
    *   P5: Bottom-Left
    *   P6: Bottom-Right

3.  **Connection Rules:**
    *   **Rule 1 (Rotation):** Depots can be rotated. Our `Depot` class will handle this with a `rotateClockwise()` method.
    *   **Rule 2 (No Flipping):** We don't need to consider mirror images, simplifying rotations.
    *   **Rule 3 (Center Depot Orientation):** The central depot (which is `Depot 6` based on the example output mapping `6C` to the center position `P3`) must be oriented so its alphabetically lowest character is on its *right* wall (index 1). This is a strong constraint that fixes the orientation of the central depot uniquely and can be used to pre-place it.
    *   **Rule 4 (Matching Textures):** Adjacent depots must have matching textures on their shared walls. We need a predefined list of connections between layout positions and their specific wall indices.

4.  **Algorithm - Backtracking with Pre-placement:**
    Given the unique solution constraint and the specific rule for the center depot, a backtracking approach is suitable.

    *   **Pre-processing:**
        1.  Read all 7 depots from input, storing their original index and wall textures.
        2.  Identify the central depot. Based on the example output (`6C` for the center position), `initialDepots[6]` (the 7th input line) is the central depot.
        3.  Apply Rule 3: Rotate this central depot (`initialDepots[6]`) until its alphabetically lowest character is at wall index 1.
        4.  Place this now-oriented central depot at `board[3]` (our `P3` layout position) and mark its ID as used.

    *   **Backtracking Function (`findSolution`):**
        1.  **State:** An array `board` storing `Depot` objects at their layout positions (or `null` if empty), and a boolean array `usedDepotIds` to track which original depots have been placed.
        2.  **Positions to fill:** We'll iterate through the remaining 6 outer positions (P0, P1, P2, P4, P5, P6) in a defined order.
        3.  **Base Case:** If all 6 outer positions are successfully filled, a solution has been found. Return `true`.
        4.  **Recursive Step:**
            *   For the current position to fill (`currentBoardPosition`), iterate through all `initialDepots` that have not yet been `used`.
            *   For each unused `depotToPlace`:
                *   Mark `depotToPlace` as `used`.
                *   Save its current wall orientation (for backtracking).
                *   Try all 6 possible rotations for `depotToPlace`:
                    *   Place `depotToPlace` at `board[currentBoardPosition]`.
                    *   **Validation:** Check `checkCurrentConnections()`. This function verifies if `depotToPlace`'s walls match any already placed adjacent depots according to the `CONNECTIONS` list.
                    *   If valid: Recursively call `findSolution` for the next position. If it returns `true`, propagate `true` up (solution found!).
                    *   If not valid or recursive call returns `false`: Backtrack by rotating `depotToPlace` for the next rotation attempt.
                *   If all 6 rotations failed: Backtrack by removing `depotToPlace` from `board`, marking it as `unused`, and restoring its original wall orientation (from before trying this depot).
        5.  If no depot and rotation works for the current position, return `false`.

5.  **Output:** Once `findSolution` returns `true`, iterate through `board` from `P0` to `P6` (output order), and for each depot, append its ID and its right-wall texture to the result string.

**Detailed Connection List (`CONNECTIONS`):**

This list defines which wall of which depot connects to which wall of another depot. `[pos1_idx, wall1_idx, pos2_idx, wall2_idx]`. Wall indices are 0=Top, 1=Top-Right, 2=Bottom-Right, 3=Bottom, 4=Bottom-Left, 5=Top-Left.

```
const CONNECTIONS: Array<[number, number, number, number]> = [
    // Connections involving the center depot (P3)
    [3, 0, 1, 3], // P3's Top wall (0) connects to P1's Bottom wall (3)
    [3, 1, 4, 4], // P3's Top-Right wall (1) connects to P4's Bottom-Left wall (4)
    [3, 2, 6, 5], // P3's Bottom-Right wall (2) connects to P6's Top-Left wall (5)
    [3, 3, 5, 0], // P3's Bottom wall (3) connects to P5's Top wall (0)
    [3, 4, 2, 1], // P3's Bottom-Left wall (4) connects to P2's Top-Right wall (1)
    [3, 5, 0, 2], // P3's Top-Left wall (5) connects to P0's Bottom-Right wall (2)

    // Connections between outer depots
    [0, 1, 1, 5], // P0's Top-Right wall (1) connects to P1's Top-Left wall (5)
    [0, 3, 2, 0], // P0's Bottom wall (3) connects to P2's Top wall (0)
    [1, 2, 4, 5], // P1's Bottom-Right wall (2) connects to P4's Top-Left wall (5)
    [2, 2, 5, 5], // P2's Bottom-Right wall (2) connects to P5's Top-Left wall (5)
    [4, 3, 6, 0], // P4's Bottom wall (3) connects to P6's Top wall (0)
    [5, 1, 6, 4]  // P5's Top-Right wall (1) connects to P6's Bottom-Left wall (4)
