The problem asks us to simulate a duck hunt. We are given the field of view for the first two turns, which allows us to deduce the movement (velocity) of each duck. From the third turn onwards, we can shoot one duck per turn. The goal is to shoot the maximum number of ducks. The problem states there's a "unique solution" for this, implying a greedy strategy will work. The most logical greedy strategy is to prioritize shooting ducks that are about to leave the field of view.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1.  **Data Structures**:
    *   `Point`: An interface `{ x: number, y: number }` to represent coordinates and velocity vectors.
    *   `Duck`: An interface to store information about each duck:
        *   `id`: The duck's unique identifier.
        *   `initialPos`: Its coordinates on Turn 1.
        *   `turn2Pos`: Its coordinates on Turn 2.
        *   `currentPos`: Its current coordinates during the simulation (updates each turn).
        *   `velocity`: Its movement vector `{vx, vy}` calculated from `turn2Pos - initialPos`.
        *   `isAlive`: A boolean flag indicating if the duck is still in play (not shot and not out of bounds).
    *   `ducks`: A `Map<number, Duck>` to easily access ducks by their ID.

2.  **Input Parsing and Duck Initialization**:
    *   Read `W` (width) and `H` (height).
    *   Read the `H` lines for Turn 1 and store the grid.
    *   Read the `H` lines for Turn 2 and store the grid.
    *   Create two temporary maps (`positionsTurn1`, `positionsTurn2`) to store the `id -> position` for each duck observed in Turn 1 and Turn 2 respectively.
    *   Iterate through `positionsTurn1`. For each duck ID, check if it also exists in `positionsTurn2`. This is crucial because we need two points to determine a duck's linear velocity. Ducks present in only one grid cannot have their movement fully determined and thus cannot be tracked for shooting.
    *   For each duck present in both turns:
        *   Calculate its `velocity` (`vx = turn2Pos.x - initialPos.x`, `vy = turn2Pos.y - initialPos.y`).
        *   Initialize `currentPos` to `turn2Pos`. This sets up `currentPos` to represent the duck's position at the beginning of Turn 3 (when shooting starts), effectively representing its state after Turn 2 movement.
        *   Set `isAlive` to `true`.

3.  **Simulation Loop (Turns 3 onwards)**:
    *   Initialize `shotDucks` array to store output in order.
    *   Start `currentTurn` at 3.
    *   The loop continues as long as there are `activeDucks` (ducks that are still alive).
    *   **Inside each turn**:
        1.  **Advance Ducks**: For every `duck` that is `isAlive`:
            *   Update `duck.currentPos` by adding its `velocity`. After this step, `duck.currentPos` represents its position *at the end of the current turn*.
            *   Check if `duck.currentPos` is now out of the `[0, W-1]` and `[0, H-1]` bounds. If it is, set `duck.isAlive = false`. This duck can no longer be shot.
        2.  **Filter Active Ducks**: Create a list `activeDucks` by filtering `ducks.values()` for those where `isAlive` is still `true`.
        3.  **Termination Check**: If `activeDucks` is empty, it means all ducks have either been shot or have flown out of the field of view. Break the loop.
        4.  **Identify Vulnerable Ducks**: Iterate through `activeDucks`. For each duck, calculate its projected position for the *next* turn (`duck.currentPos + duck.velocity`). If this projected position is out of bounds, the duck is "vulnerable" and must be shot this turn to prevent it from escaping. Add such ducks to `vulnerableDucks`.
        5.  **Shoot a Duck**:
            *   If `vulnerableDucks` is not empty, it means there's at least one duck we *must* shoot.
            *   To ensure a deterministic "unique solution" (as per the problem statement), sort `vulnerableDucks` by `id` (e.g., ascending). This makes the choice consistent if multiple ducks are equally vulnerable.
            *   Take the first duck from the sorted `vulnerableDucks` list.
            *   Add its `id`, `currentPos.x`, and `currentPos.y` to the `shotDucks` array.
            *   Set `duckToShoot.isAlive = false`. (Only one duck can be shot per turn).
        6.  Increment `currentTurn`.

4.  **Output**: After the loop terminates, iterate through the `shotDucks` array and `print` each entry in the format `ID x y`.

This simulation correctly models the movement and shooting logic, prioritizing ducks that are about to escape, ensuring the maximum number of kills.
