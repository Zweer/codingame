The puzzle "DDCG Mapper" requires generating a map for a rhythm game based on provided patterns and tempos. The core challenge lies in correctly interpreting the "map starts from the bottom to the top" warning and how pattern tempos apply, especially in relation to the example output.

Here's the breakdown of the logic derived from analyzing the problem statement and the provided example:

1.  **Map Representation:** We'll use a 0-indexed array, `map_lines`, of size `L`. `map_lines[0]` will represent the bottom-most line of the map, and `map_lines[L-1]` will represent the top-most line. Each element will be a 4-character string, initialized to "0000".

2.  **Pattern Application Logic:**
    *   The phrase "reproduce the pattern every `Tempo` lines" implies a modular arithmetic condition.
    *   The "Warning: the map starts from the bottom to the top!" is key. This implies that the lines are conceptually numbered starting from 1 at the bottom. So, for a line at 0-indexed position `k` in our `map_lines` array, its 1-indexed conceptual line number is `k + 1`.
    *   A pattern `P` with `Tempo T` applies to a line if its 1-indexed conceptual line number (`k + 1`) is a multiple of `T` (i.e., `(k + 1) % T === 0`).
    *   If a line has no patterns applied, it remains "0000".
    *   If multiple patterns apply to a single line, crosses ('X') accumulate. This means for each of the 4 character positions, if *any* applicable pattern has an 'X' at that position, the resulting character for that position will be 'X'. Otherwise, it will be '0'.

3.  **Output Order:**
    *   While the map conceptualizes from bottom to top (line 1 is bottom, line `L` is top), the standard way to print output to a console is from top to bottom.
    *   Therefore, after generating all lines in `map_lines` (where `map_lines[0]` is bottom and `map_lines[L-1]` is top), we must print them in reverse order: `map_lines[L-1]`, then `map_lines[L-2]`, and so on, down to `map_lines[0]`. This order perfectly matches the provided example output.

**Step-by-step Algorithm:**

1.  Read `L` (map length) and `N` (number of patterns).
2.  Create an array to store `N` pattern objects, each with a `pattern` string and a `tempo` number.
3.  Initialize `map_lines`: an array of `L` strings, each set to "0000".
4.  Loop `k` from `0` to `L-1` (representing the 0-indexed position in `map_lines`):
    *   Calculate `currentLineNumber = k + 1` (this is the 1-indexed conceptual line number).
    *   Retrieve the current state of `map_lines[k]`.
    *   For each stored `patternInfo` (`pattern`, `tempo`):
        *   If `currentLineNumber % patternInfo.tempo === 0`:
            *   Combine `patternInfo.pattern` with the current line string. Create a new 4-character string where each character is 'X' if either the current line's character or the pattern's character at that position is 'X', otherwise '0'.
            *   Update the current line string with this combined result.
    *   Store the final `currentLineString` back into `map_lines[k]`.
5.  After the loop, iterate from `k = L - 1` down to `0`, and print `map_lines[k]` for each iteration.
