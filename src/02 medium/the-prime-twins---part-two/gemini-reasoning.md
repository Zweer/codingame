The puzzle asks us to implement an encoding and decoding scheme based on prime twins. The core idea revolves around `key` and `i`, where `i` is the integer between a pair of prime twins (p, p+2), so `i = p+1`.

**Encoding Principles:**
1.  **For 'A':** It transforms into `key + key`.
2.  **For subsequent letters (B, C, ...):** The value is `key + i`. The `i` for a letter is found by locating the smallest prime `p` such that `p` is strictly greater than the *encoded value of the previous letter*. Once `p` is found, `i = p+1`.
3.  **Spaces:** A space is represented by "GG" in the output. Spaces do not affect the sequence of prime twin `i` values for subsequent letters; the `prev_encoded_val` for calculating `i` continues from the last letter.
4.  **Output Format:** Resulting integers are converted to uppercase hexadecimal. Letters are separated by 'G', and spaces by 'GG'. Example: `ABC` becomes `6GFG15`. `A B` (A space B) would become `6GGF`.

**Decoding Principles:**
1.  **Input Format:** Messages contain uppercase hexadecimal values and the letter 'G'.
2.  **Reverse mapping:** The process for decoding is the reverse of encoding. We parse the hexadecimal values and 'G'/'GG' separators. 'GG' maps to a space. Each hexadecimal value corresponds to an encoded letter.
3.  **Letter sequence:** The first letter value decoded is 'A', the second 'B', and so on. Spaces do not count towards this sequence.
4.  **Validation:** Both encoding and decoding must validate input message formats and return "ERROR !!" if they don't comply. This also includes verifying that the `i` values correspond to the "closest strictly greater" rule.

**Core Components & Logic:**

1.  **Prime Twin Precomputation:**
    *   To efficiently find prime twins, we use a Sieve of Eratosthenes. The maximum value for a prime `p` can be estimated. The `key` can be up to `5 * 10^6`. The `i` value (between primes) can go up to `~2.5 * 10^6` for messages around `10^4` characters long. So, `key + i` can reach `7.5 * 10^6`. Thus, primes up to roughly `8 * 10^6` are needed.
    *   `MAX_PRIME_SEARCH_LIMIT` is set to `8,000,000`.
    *   `isPrime` boolean array: `isPrime[x]` is true if `x` is prime.
    *   `sorted_i_values`: An array storing all `i` values (where `i=p+1` for prime twin pair `(p, p+2)`) in ascending order. This list is crucial for quickly finding the "next" `i` and for validating decoded `i` values.

2.  **`encodeMessage` function:**
    *   Iterates through the input `message` character by character.
    *   Maintains `prev_encoded_val_for_calc` to track the last letter's encoded value for subsequent `i` calculations.
    *   If the character is a space, "GG" is noted for output.
    *   If it's a letter:
        *   If it's the first letter encountered: `encoded_val = key + key`.
        *   Otherwise: It iterates `sorted_i_values` to find the first `candidate_i_val` where `candidate_i_val - 1` (which is `p`) is strictly greater than `prev_encoded_val_for_calc`. `encoded_val = key + next_i_val`.
    *   The `prev_encoded_val_for_calc` is updated after each letter.
    *   The output string is built by appending hex values and inserting 'G' or 'GG' separators based on the `message` content and the output formatting rules.

3.  **`decodeMessage` function:**
    *   **Input Validation & Tokenization:**
        *   First, it checks if the message contains only valid characters (`0-9A-F`, `G`).
        *   Then, it uses a regular expression `(/([0-9A-F]+)|(G{1,2})/g)` to parse the message into a sequence of `tokens`. Each token is either a hexadecimal string (`[0-9A-F]+`) or a separator (`G` or `GG`).
        *   It strictly validates the sequence of these tokens: they must alternate `HEX, SEP, HEX, SEP, ... HEX`. The sequence must start and end with a hexadecimal value. Any deviation (e.g., `G6`, `6G`, `GGG`, non-alternating sequence) results in an "ERROR !!"
    *   **Decoding Logic:**
        *   Iterates through the validated `tokens`.
        *   If a token is 'GG', a space is added to the `decoded_message_chars`.
        *   If a token is 'G', it's a separator, so it's skipped.
        *   If it's a hexadecimal string (representing an encoded number):
            *   Parses the hex string to `current_encoded_val`.
            *   If it's the first letter being decoded: Checks if `current_encoded_val` is `key + key`. If not, "ERROR !!". Adds 'A'.
            *   Otherwise: Calculates `required_i_val = current_encoded_val - key`. It then checks `sorted_i_values` to verify if `required_i_val` is indeed the *closest* valid `i` following `prev_encoded_val_for_calc`. If it's not the closest or invalid, "ERROR !!".
            *   Determines the character (B, C, etc.) based on the count of previously decoded letters (excluding spaces). Validates against 'Z'.
        *   `prev_encoded_val_for_calc` is updated after each letter.
    *   Finally, returns the joined `decoded_message_chars`.

**Complexity:**
*   **Precomputation:** Sieve is `O(N log log N)` where `N` is `MAX_PRIME_SEARCH_LIMIT`. Populating `sorted_i_values` is `O(N)`. This runs once.
*   **Encoding/Decoding:** For a message of length `L`:
    *   Tokenization: `O(L)`.
    *   Looping through characters/tokens: `O(L)`.
    *   Inside the loop, searching `sorted_i_values` (for `encode`) or verifying `required_i_val` (for `decode`) is `O(log K)` where `K` is `MAX_PRIME_SEARCH_LIMIT` (effectively `log` of the max `i` value). A linear scan of `sorted_i_values` is `O(N_i)` where `N_i` is the number of prime twin `i` values (up to ~250k). This is acceptable for `L` up to `10^4`.
*   Overall complexity is efficient enough for typical CodinGame constraints.
