The problem asks us to determine if a given set of dominoes can form a single path. Dominoes can be reversed and reordered. This is a classic graph theory problem that can be solved by checking for the existence of an Eulerian path.

**Graph Representation:**
We can model the dominoes as an undirected graph. Each number (0 to 6) represents a vertex in the graph, and each domino `A B` represents an edge between vertex `A` and vertex `B`. Since dominoes can be reversed, the edges are undirected.

**Conditions for an Eulerian Path:**
An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if:
1.  **Connectivity:** All vertices with a non-zero degree (i.e., those that are part of at least one domino) belong to the same connected component.
2.  **Degree Count:** There are at most two vertices with an odd degree. If there are zero odd-degree vertices, an Eulerian circuit (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex) exists. If there are exactly two odd-degree vertices, an Eulerian path exists, starting at one odd-degree vertex and ending at the other. If there are more than two odd-degree vertices, no Eulerian path is possible. (Note: The sum of degrees in any graph is an even number, so the number of odd-degree vertices must always be even.)

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Initialize Data Structures:**
    *   `degrees[7]`: An array to store the degree of each vertex (0-6). Initialize all to 0. The degree of a vertex is the number of times it appears on a domino end.
    *   `graph[7]`: An adjacency list (array of arrays) to represent the graph for connectivity checks. `graph[i]` will store an array of vertices connected to `i`.
    *   `distinctNodes`: A `Set` to keep track of all unique numbers (vertices) that appear on any domino. This is used to count relevant nodes for connectivity.

2.  **Process Input Dominoes:**
    *   For each domino `A B`:
        *   Increment `degrees[A]` and `degrees[B]`.
        *   Add `B` to `graph[A]` and `A` to `graph[B]` (representing an undirected edge).
        *   Add `A` and `B` to the `distinctNodes` set.

3.  **Check Connectivity (BFS/DFS):**
    *   Find a `startNode`: Pick any vertex from `distinctNodes`. Since `N >= 2`, `distinctNodes` will not be empty.
    *   Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from `startNode` to explore all reachable vertices.
    *   Keep track of `visited` vertices and `visitedCount` (number of unique `distinctNodes` visited).
    *   After the traversal, compare `visitedCount` with `distinctNodes.size`. If they are not equal, it means there are multiple connected components of dominoes, and thus no single path can be formed. Output `false`.

4.  **Check Odd Degree Vertices:**
    *   Iterate through the `degrees` array (from 0 to 6).
    *   Count how many vertices `i` have `degrees[i] % 2 !== 0`. Store this in `oddDegreeCount`.

5.  **Determine Result:**
    *   If `oddDegreeCount` is 0 or 2, an Eulerian path exists. Output `true`.
    *   Otherwise (if `oddDegreeCount` is 4 or 6, as it must be even), no Eulerian path exists. Output `false`.

**Example Walkthrough (Input: 2, 1 2, 2 3):**

1.  **Initialize:** `degrees = [0,...,0]`, `graph = [[],...,[]]`, `distinctNodes = {}`.
2.  **Process Dominoes:**
    *   (1,2): `degrees[1]=1`, `degrees[2]=1`. `graph[1]=[2]`, `graph[2]=[1]`. `distinctNodes = {1,2}`.
    *   (2,3): `degrees[2]=2`, `degrees[3]=1`. `graph[2].push(3)`, `graph[3].push(2)`. `distinctNodes = {1,2,3}`.
    *   Final `degrees = [0,1,2,1,0,0,0]`.
    *   Final `graph`: `graph[1]=[2]`, `graph[2]=[1,3]`, `graph[3]=[2]`.
3.  **Connectivity:**
    *   `startNode = 1` (from `distinctNodes`).
    *   BFS starts from 1, visits 2, then visits 3.
    *   `visitedCount = 3`. `distinctNodes.size = 3`.
    *   `visitedCount === distinctNodes.size` (3 === 3), so connected.
4.  **Odd Degree Count:**
    *   `degrees[1] = 1` (odd)
    *   `degrees[2] = 2` (even)
    *   `degrees[3] = 1` (odd)
    *   `oddDegreeCount = 2`.
5.  **Result:** `oddDegreeCount` is 2, so output `true`.
