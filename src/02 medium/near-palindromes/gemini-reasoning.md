The problem asks us to determine if a given word is a "near-palindrome". A near-palindrome is defined as a word that is "one letter away from being a palindrome, be it by replacement, addition or removal." For each input word, we need to output `1` if it's a near-palindrome and `0` otherwise.

**Interpretation of "One Letter Away":**

A crucial aspect is the interpretation of "one letter away". This typically implies an edit distance of *exactly* 1.
*   If a word is already a palindrome (e.g., "racecar", "level"), it needs 0 edits to become a palindrome. Therefore, based on the "exactly 1 edit" interpretation, an existing palindrome is **not** a near-palindrome. This aligns with the common understanding of "N away" implying N > 0.
*   If a word requires 2 or more edits to become a palindrome, it's also not a near-palindrome.

**Algorithm:**

The core idea is to use a two-pointer approach to find the first mismatch in the word. Once a mismatch is found, we explore three possibilities for fixing it with a single edit:

1.  **Check for an existing palindrome:**
    First, verify if the input `word` is already a palindrome. If it is, return `0` based on our interpretation.

2.  **Find the first mismatch:**
    Use two pointers, `left` starting at the beginning of the word (`0`) and `right` starting at the end (`word.length - 1`). Move `left` forward and `right` backward as long as `word[left]` equals `word[right]`.

3.  **Explore single-edit scenarios from the mismatch:**
    When the loop terminates, `left` and `right` either cross (meaning the word was a palindrome, already handled) or point to the first pair of characters that do not match (`word[left] !== word[right]`). From this point of mismatch, we test three possibilities:

    *   **Scenario 1: One Removal (from `left`) / One Addition (to `right`):**
        Assume `word[left]` is the extra character that needs to be removed. Check if the substring `word[left+1 ... right]` is a palindrome. If it is, then removing `word[left]` makes the whole word a palindrome.

    *   **Scenario 2: One Removal (from `right`) / One Addition (to `left`):**
        Assume `word[right]` is the extra character that needs to be removed. Check if the substring `word[left ... right-1]` is a palindrome. If it is, then removing `word[right]` makes the whole word a palindrome.

    *   **Scenario 3: One Replacement:**
        Assume either `word[left]` or `word[right]` needs to be replaced to match its counterpart. This implies that the rest of the inner substring `word[left+1 ... right-1]` must already be a palindrome. If it is, then one replacement (`word[left]` to `word[right]` or vice-versa) makes the whole word a palindrome.

    If any of these three checks results in a palindrome, the word is a near-palindrome, and we return `1`. If none of them do, we return `0`.

**Helper Function `isPalindrome(s: string, start: number, end: number)`:**
This function checks if a substring of `s` (from `start` to `end` inclusive) is a palindrome. It uses a simple two-pointer approach internally. Empty substrings or single-character substrings are considered palindromes.

**Complexity:**

*   For each word, the initial two-pointer scan takes `O(L)` time (where `L` is word length).
*   The three subsequent `isPalindrome` checks on substrings also take `O(L)` time in the worst case.
*   Total time complexity per word is `O(L)`.
*   Given `N < 1000` and `word length < 10000`, the total time complexity is `N * O(L)`, which is `1000 * 10000 = 10^7`. This is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually around `10^8` operations per second).
*   Space complexity is `O(1)` (excluding input/output storage).

**Example Dry Runs:**

*   **`ricecar`**:
    1. Not a palindrome.
    2. `left=0, right=6`. `r` vs `r` (match) -> `l=1, r=5`.
    3. `left=1, right=5`. `i` vs `a` (mismatch). Loop stops.
    4. Scenarios:
        *   `isPalindrome("ricecar", 1+1, 5)` -> `isPalindrome("ceca")` -> `false`.
        *   `isPalindrome("ricecar", 1, 5-1)` -> `isPalindrome("icec")` -> `false`.
        *   `isPalindrome("ricecar", 1+1, 5-1)` -> `isPalindrome("cec")` -> `true`. Return `1`. (By replacing 'i' with 'a' or 'a' with 'i', it becomes 'racecar').

*   **`racecars`**:
    1. Not a palindrome.
    2. `left=0, right=7`. `r` vs `s` (mismatch). Loop stops.
    3. Scenarios:
        *   `isPalindrome("racecars", 0+1, 7)` -> `isPalindrome("acecars")` -> `false`.
        *   `isPalindrome("racecars", 0, 7-1)` -> `isPalindrome("racecar")` -> `true`. Return `1`. (By removing 's', it becomes 'racecar').

The logic holds for the given examples and edge cases like single-character strings or empty strings (which would also return `0` as they are already palindromes).
