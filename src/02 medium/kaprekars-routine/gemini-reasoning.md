The puzzle asks us to simulate a routine similar to Kaprekar's operation. Given an initial positive integer `n1`, we derive the next number `n2` by calculating `D(n1) - A(n1)`, where `D(x)` is `x` with its digits sorted in descending order, and `A(x)` is `x` with its digits sorted in ascending order. This process is repeated until a number is encountered that has already appeared in the sequence, indicating a cycle. We must then output the numbers forming this cycle.

A crucial detail is that all numbers `ni` in the sequence must maintain the same number of digits as the initial `n1`, padding with leading zeros if necessary. For example, if `n1` is "123" (3 digits) and a subsequent calculation yields 4, it must be treated as "004" for `D(x)` and `A(x)` calculations, and for cycle detection.

Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Input Reading**: Read the initial number `n` as a string. This allows us to easily determine its length, which is crucial for padding.

2.  **`padNumber` Helper**: A helper function `padNumber(num: number, length: number)` is needed to convert a number into its string representation, ensuring it has `length` digits by adding leading zeros if necessary. For example, `padNumber(9, 2)` should return `"09"`, and `padNumber(4, 3)` should return `"004"`.

3.  **`getD(numStr: string)` and `getA(numStr: string)` Helpers**:
    *   These functions take the *padded string representation* of a number.
    *   To get `D(x)`, the digits of `numStr` are split into an array, sorted in descending order (e.g., `'9', '0'` from `"09"` or `'4', '0', '0'` from `"004"`), joined back into a string, and then parsed as an integer.
    *   To get `A(x)`, the digits are sorted in ascending order, joined, and parsed. This correctly handles leading zeros (e.g., `'0', '9'` from `"09"` becomes `9` and `'0', '0', '4'` from `"004"` becomes `4`).

4.  **Cycle Detection**:
    *   We use a `Map` named `seen` to store previously encountered numbers, mapping their *padded string representation* to the index at which they first appeared in our sequence.
    *   We also maintain an array `sequence` to store the *padded string representations* of all numbers generated so far, in order.
    *   We start a loop:
        *   In each iteration, we take the current number, pad it to the `initialLength` to get `currentNumPaddedStr`.
        *   We check if `currentNumPaddedStr` is already in the `seen` map.
            *   If yes, a cycle is detected. The cycle starts from the index stored in `seen` for `currentNumPaddedStr`. We extract this portion from `sequence` and print it.
            *   If no, we add `currentNumPaddedStr` to `seen` with its current index (`sequence.length`), and push `currentNumPaddedStr` into the `sequence` array.
        *   Then, we calculate the next number `nextNum = D(currentNumPaddedStr) - A(currentNumPaddedStr)`.
        *   We update `currentNum` to `nextNum` and continue the loop.

This process guarantees that a cycle will eventually be found, as there's a finite number of possible integers within a fixed digit length.

**Example Trace for `n = "09"`:**
- `initialLength = 2`
- `sequence = []`, `seen = {}`
- `currentNum = 9`

1.  `currentNumPaddedStr = "09"`. Not in `seen`. `seen["09"] = 0`, `sequence = ["09"]`.
    `D("09") = 90`, `A("09") = 9`. `nextNum = 90 - 9 = 81`. `currentNum = 81`.
2.  `currentNumPaddedStr = "81"`. Not in `seen`. `seen["81"] = 1`, `sequence = ["09", "81"]`.
    `D("81") = 81`, `A("81") = 18`. `nextNum = 81 - 18 = 63`. `currentNum = 63`.
3.  `currentNumPaddedStr = "63"`. Not in `seen`. `seen["63"] = 2`, `sequence = ["09", "81", "63"]`.
    `D("63") = 63`, `A("63") = 36`. `nextNum = 63 - 36 = 27`. `currentNum = 27`.
4.  `currentNumPaddedStr = "27"`. Not in `seen`. `seen["27"] = 3`, `sequence = ["09", "81", "63", "27"]`.
    `D("27") = 72`, `A("27") = 27`. `nextNum = 72 - 27 = 45`. `currentNum = 45`.
5.  `currentNumPaddedStr = "45"`. Not in `seen`. `seen["45"] = 4`, `sequence = ["09", "81", "63", "27", "45"]`.
    `D("45") = 54`, `A("45") = 45`. `nextNum = 54 - 45 = 9`. `currentNum = 9`.
6.  `currentNumPaddedStr = "09"`. In `seen` at index `0`.
    Cycle detected! Slice `sequence` from index `0`: `["09", "81", "63", "27", "45"]`. Print this.
