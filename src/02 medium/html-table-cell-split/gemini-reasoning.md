The puzzle asks us to simulate the splitting of a cell in an HTML table and output the new colspan and rowspan values for all cells. The main challenges are:
1.  **Parsing the input table structure**: The input describes cells that start in a given row, not every cell in every row. Cells can span multiple rows and columns.
2.  **Identifying the cell to split**: The cell is given by its 0-based index in the input sequence. We need to map this to its actual row and column in the table layout.
3.  **Applying the split**: A cell `(CS, RS)` is replaced by two cells. If split horizontally ('C'), a `(1, RS)` and another `(1, RS)`. If split vertically ('R'), a `(CS, 1)` and another `(CS, 1)`. The constraint states that the cell always has a span of 1 in the direction it's being split, which simplifies the division.
4.  **Adjusting other cells' spans**: When a column or row is effectively inserted into the grid, cells that span across this new boundary must have their `colspan` or `rowspan` increased to maintain their relative layout.
5.  **Generating the output**: The output must list cells row by row, from left to right, only including cells whose top-left corner is in that row. If a vertical split occurs, an additional row might be in the output.

### Approach:

We'll use a multi-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Initial Table Parsing and Cell Information Storage**

1.  **`CellInfo` Interface**: Define a structure to hold information about each cell:
    *   `id`: A unique numerical ID for the cell (corresponding to its input order).
    *   `cs`: Current `colspan` value (will be updated).
    *   `rs`: Current `rowspan` value (will be updated).
    *   `startR_initial`: The row index where this cell's top-left corner is located in the *original* table layout.
    *   `startC_initial`: The column index where this cell's top-left corner is located in the *original* table layout.
    *   `originalInputRowIdx`: The row index in the input string where this cell was defined.
    *   `originalInputCellIdxInRow`: The index within that specific input row. These are used later for sorting to maintain relative order.
    *   `isSplitPart`: A boolean, `true` if this cell is the *new* cell created by the split.

2.  **`allCells` Array**: Store all `CellInfo` objects created from the input in a flat array, maintaining their input order.

3.  **`initialLayoutGrid`**: A 2D array (`CellInfo | null | 'OCCUPIED'`) to represent the *initial* visual layout of the table.
    *   `CellInfo` object: If a cell's top-left corner is at `(r, c)`.
    *   `null`: If the `(r, c)` position is empty.
    *   `'OCCUPIED'`: If the `(r, c)` position is covered by a cell that started in an earlier row or column (a spanning cell).
    *   This grid is used to:
        *   Determine `startR_initial` and `startC_initial` for each cell during parsing.
        *   Find the `(r, c)` coordinates of the `cellToSplit`.

4.  **Parsing Logic**: Iterate through input rows. For each row, iterate through `currentLogicalCol` skipping `OCCUPIED` cells or already placed top-left cells until an empty slot is found. Place the new cell's `CellInfo` object there and mark its covered area as `OCCUPIED`.

**Phase 2: Apply Split and Adjust Spans**

1.  **Find `cellToSplit`**: Retrieve the `CellInfo` object for the cell to be split from `allCells` using `splitCellIdx`.
2.  **Determine `splitCellR_initial`, `splitCellC_initial`**: Locate the `cellToSplit`'s `startR_initial` and `startC_initial` using the `initialLayoutGrid`.
3.  **Modify `cellToSplit` and Create `newCellPart`**:
    *   If `splitDirection` is 'C': Set `cellToSplit.cs = 1`. Create a `newCellPart` with `cs=1`, `rs=cellToSplit.rs`, mark `isSplitPart=true`, and set its `originalInputRowIdx` and `originalInputCellIdxInRow` to ensure it sorts immediately after the original part. Its conceptual `startC_initial` will be `splitCellC_initial + 1`.
    *   If `splitDirection` is 'R': Set `cellToSplit.rs = 1`. Create a `newCellPart` with `rs=1`, `cs=cellToSplit.cs`, mark `isSplitPart=true`, and set its `originalInputRowIdx` and `originalInputCellIdxInRow` similarly. Its conceptual `startR_initial` will be `splitCellR_initial + 1`.
    *   Add `newCellPart` to `allCells`. Increment `newNumRows` if 'R' split.
4.  **Adjust Spans of Other Cells**:
    *   **For 'C' split**: For every other cell `X` in `allCells`, if its *rightmost covered column* (`X.startC_initial + X.cs - 1`) is greater than or equal to `splitCellC_initial`, increment `X.cs`. (This rule directly matches the example's behavior for 'B' and 'D'.)
    *   **For 'R' split**: For every other cell `X` in `allCells`, if its *bottommost covered row* (`X.startR_initial + X.rs - 1`) is greater than or equal to `splitCellR_initial`, increment `X.rs`.

**Phase 3: Generate Final Layout and Output**

1.  **`cellsForFinalLayout`**: Create a mutable copy of `allCells`. These objects will have their `finalR` and `finalC` properties updated to reflect their new positions after the split and shifts.
    *   If `splitDirection` is 'C': For any cell `X` where `X.startC_initial > splitCellC_initial`, increment `X.finalC`. The new split part also gets `finalC = splitCellC_initial + 1`. The original part gets `finalC = splitCellC_initial`.
    *   If `splitDirection` is 'R': For any cell `X` where `X.startR_initial > splitCellR_initial`, increment `X.finalR`. The new split part gets `finalR = splitCellR_initial + 1`. The original part gets `finalR = splitCellR_initial`.
2.  **Sort `cellsForFinalLayout`**: Sort this array by `finalR` then `finalC` to ensure cells are processed in top-left to bottom-right order.
3.  **`outputGrid`**: A 2D array (`CellInfo | null | -1`) representing the final table layout where `CellInfo` objects are placed at their *final* top-left corners. `-1` denotes an occupied cell (part of a span).
4.  **Populate `outputGrid`**: Iterate through the sorted `cellsForFinalLayout`. For each cell, place its `CellInfo` object at `(cell.finalR, cell.finalC)` in `outputGrid`, and mark all other cells it covers as `-1`.
5.  **Print Output**: Iterate `r` from `0` to `newNumRows - 1`. For each row, iterate `c` from `0` across the maximum possible column width. If `outputGrid[r][c]` contains a `CellInfo` object (meaning it's a top-left cell), print its `cs,rs`. Skip `null` (empty beyond last cell) and `-1` (occupied by a spanning cell).

### Considerations:

*   **Max Grid Dimensions**: The problem doesn't specify maximum `colspan` or total table width. We use a generous `MAX_GRID_DIM` (e.g., 600) to prevent out-of-bounds errors, as column/row counts can increase.
*   **Floating-Point `originalInputCellIdxInRow`**: Using `+ 0.5` for new split parts ensures they sort correctly right after their original counterparts when using `originalInputRowIdx` and `originalInputCellIdxInRow` as primary sort keys. This helps maintain the "relative layout" concept.
