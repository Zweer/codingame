The problem asks us to simulate a simplified version of Monopoly to predict the final positions of players after a series of given dice rolls. The game involves a circular board, movement based on dice sums, special rules for rolling doubles, and rules for entering and exiting jail.

Here's a breakdown of the logic implemented:

1.  **Game State Representation:**
    *   **Board:** A circular board with 40 positions (0-39). Key positions are `JAIL_POSITION` (10) and `GO_TO_JAIL_POSITION` (30).
    *   **Player:** Each player needs to track:
        *   `name`: Their identifier.
        *   `position`: Their current location on the board (0-39).
        *   `inJail`: A boolean indicating if they are currently in jail.
        *   `jailTurnsCount`: An integer tracking how many turns they have spent in jail trying to get out. This resets when they enter or leave jail.
        *   `consecutiveDoubles`: An integer tracking how many consecutive doubles they have rolled in their current turn (while not in jail). This resets after a non-double roll, or when they go to jail.
        *   `originalOrder`: An integer to remember their initial input order, as the output must preserve it.

2.  **Input Processing:**
    *   The number of players (`P`) is read.
    *   For each player, their name and initial position are read, and a `Player` object is created.
    *   The total number of dice rolls (`D`) is read.
    *   All `D` dice rolls (two numbers each) are read and stored in an array.
    *   The 40 board position names are read and discarded, as they are explicitly stated to not be needed for this puzzle.

3.  **Simulation Loop:**
    *   The simulation iterates through the `D` pre-defined dice rolls in their given order.
    *   A `currentPlayerIndex` variable keeps track of whose turn it is. This index only advances to the next player *after* the current player's turn has fully ended.

4.  **Turn Logic:**
    *   For each dice roll (`d1`, `d2`), calculate `sum = d1 + d2` and `isDouble = (d1 === d2)`.
    *   **If the player is in jail (`inJail` is true):**
        *   Increment `jailTurnsCount`.
        *   The player gets out of jail if they roll a double OR if `jailTurnsCount` reaches 3 (meaning this is their third attempt).
            *   If they get out: Set `inJail` to `false`, reset `jailTurnsCount` to 0. Move `sum` positions. Their turn *always* ends here, even if they rolled a double to get out.
        *   If they remain in jail (didn't roll a double and `jailTurnsCount` is less than 3): They do not move. Their turn ends.
    *   **If the player is not in jail (`inJail` is false):**
        *   **If they rolled a double:**
            *   Increment `consecutiveDoubles`.
            *   If `consecutiveDoubles` reaches 3: The player immediately goes to jail. Their `position` becomes `JAIL_POSITION` (10), `inJail` becomes `true`, `consecutiveDoubles` resets to 0, and `jailTurnsCount` resets to 0 (for the new jail sentence). Their turn ends.
            *   If `consecutiveDoubles` is less than 3: Move `sum` positions. Check if the new `position` is `GO_TO_JAIL_POSITION` (30).
                *   If they landed on `GO_TO_JAIL_POSITION`: They immediately go to jail. Their `position` becomes `JAIL_POSITION` (10), `inJail` becomes `true`, `consecutiveDoubles` resets to 0, and `jailTurnsCount` resets to 0. Their turn ends.
                *   Otherwise (did not land on `GO_TO_JAIL_POSITION`): Their turn does *not* end, and they get to roll again (meaning the `currentPlayerIndex` does not advance, and the next dice roll in the `diceRolls` array will be for this same player).
        *   **If they did not roll a double:**
            *   Reset `consecutiveDoubles` to 0.
            *   Move `sum` positions. Check if the new `position` is `GO_TO_JAIL_POSITION` (30).
                *   If they landed on `GO_TO_JAIL_POSITION`: They immediately go to jail. Their `position` becomes `JAIL_POSITION` (10), `inJail` becomes `true`, and `jailTurnsCount` resets to 0.
                *   Otherwise: They just landed on a regular square or "Visit Only / In Jail" (10).
            *   Their turn ends.

5.  **Position Calculation:** All moves are calculated using the modulo operator (`% BOARD_SIZE`) to handle the circular board (e.g., `(currentPosition + sum) % 40`).

6.  **Output:**
    *   After all dice rolls are processed, the `players` array is sorted back to its `originalOrder` to match the input player order.
    *   For each player, their `name` and final `position` are printed.

This detailed simulation correctly handles the various rules and interactions, including consecutive doubles, entering jail from `Go To Jail` or three doubles, and exiting jail via double or turn count.
