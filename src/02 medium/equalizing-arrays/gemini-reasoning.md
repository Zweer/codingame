The problem asks us to equalize two arrays, `A` and `B`, of non-negative integers by moving values between adjacent elements of array `A`. An operation consists of subtracting a value `V` from `A[P-1]` and adding `V` to `A[P-1+D]`, where `P` is a 1-based index, `D` is -1 or 1, and `V` is a positive integer. After each operation, all values in array `A` must remain non-negative. We need to find the minimum number of operations and the lexicographically smallest order of operations. A key constraint is that `sum(A[i]) = sum(B[i])`.

**Understanding the Constraints and Goal:**
1.  **Non-negative constraint:** `A[P-1] - V >= 0` must hold for any operation. This means the element from which we subtract `V` must have at least `V` units.
2.  **`sum(A) = sum(B)`:** This is crucial. It means the total amount of value in `A` is the same as in `B`. We only need to redistribute values, not create or destroy them. This property is common in "flow" or "balance" problems on a line.
3.  **Minimum operations:** We want to use as few operations as possible. This usually implies making `V` as large as possible for each operation to fully resolve a difference.
4.  **Lexicographically smallest order:** Operations are `(P, D, V)`. We prefer smaller `P`, then smaller `D` (so -1 before 1), then smaller `V`.

**Strategy - Greedy Left-to-Right Pass:**

The constraint `sum(A) = sum(B)` strongly suggests a one-pass greedy approach, typically from left to right.
Let `currentA` be the mutable array `A`. We iterate `i` from `0` to `N-2` (since `A[N-1]` will be automatically corrected due to the sum constraint). For each `i`, we aim to make `currentA[i]` equal to `B[i]`. Since elements `A[0]` through `A[i-1]` are considered "fixed" (equal to `B[0]` through `B[i-1]`), any value needed or excess from `A[i]` must interact only with `A[i+1]`.

1.  **If `currentA[i] > B[i]` (excess):**
    `currentA[i]` has an excess of `V = currentA[i] - B[i]`. This excess must be moved to `currentA[i+1]`.
    The operation would be:
    *   `P = i + 1` (source is `A[i]`, 1-based index)
    *   `D = 1` (move to the right, `A[i+1]`)
    *   `V = currentA[i] - B[i]`
    This operation is always valid regarding the non-negative constraint on the source (`A[i]`) because `currentA[i]` becomes `B[i]`, which is guaranteed non-negative. We apply this operation: `currentA[i] -= V`, `currentA[i+1] += V`.

2.  **If `currentA[i] < B[i]` (deficit):**
    `currentA[i]` has a deficit of `V = B[i] - currentA[i]`. This deficit must be covered by `currentA[i+1]`.
    The operation would be:
    *   `P = i + 2` (source is `A[i+1]`, 1-based index)
    *   `D = -1` (move to the left, `A[i]`)
    *   `V = B[i] - currentA[i]`
    This operation's validity relies on `currentA[i+1] >= V`. In problems of this type with the `sum(A) = sum(B)` and `A[k] >= 0` constraints, it is generally guaranteed that `currentA[i+1]` will have sufficient value for this operation. We apply this operation: `currentA[i] += V`, `currentA[i+1] -= V`.

**Why this strategy satisfies the requirements:**

*   **Minimum operations:** Each operation fully resolves the difference at `currentA[i]` using a single transfer, making `V` maximal for that specific `(P,D)` pair. Since we process elements one by one, each `currentA[i]` (for `i < N-1`) is fixed in one operation if it's not already `B[i]`. This typically results in `N-1` or fewer operations.
*   **Lexicographically smallest order:**
    *   **`P`:** By iterating `i` from `0` to `N-2`, we naturally prioritize operations with smaller source indices (`P`). An operation fixing `A[i]` will have `P = i+1` (if `A[i]` is source) or `P = i+2` (if `A[i+1]` is source). This ensures smaller `P` values appear earlier in the sequence.
    *   **`D`:** When an element `A[i]` needs value, it must pull from `A[i+1]`, resulting in `D=-1`. When `A[i]` has excess, it must push to `A[i+1]`, resulting in `D=1`. There's no choice for `D` at each step, so this aspect of lexicographical ordering is implicitly handled by the required direction.
    *   **`V`:** `V` is simply the magnitude of the difference (`abs(A[i]-B[i])`). Since we use the maximum `V` to clear the difference in one go, this effectively fixes `V` for the operation.

**Example Trace (from problem description):**

`N = 4`
`A = [1, 2, 0, 1]`
`B = [0, 1, 3, 0]`

`currentA = [1, 2, 0, 1]`
`operations = []`

*   **`i = 0`:** `currentA[0] = 1`, `B[0] = 0`. `currentA[0] > B[0]` (excess of 1).
    *   `V = 1 - 0 = 1`.
    *   Operation: `{ P: 1, D: 1, V: 1 }` (source `A[0]`, to `A[1]`).
    *   `operations.push({1, 1, 1})`.
    *   `currentA[0] -= 1` (becomes 0).
    *   `currentA[1] += 1` (becomes 3).
    *   `currentA` is now `[0, 3, 0, 1]`.

*   **`i = 1`:** `currentA[1] = 3`, `B[1] = 1`. `currentA[1] > B[1]` (excess of 2).
    *   `V = 3 - 1 = 2`.
    *   Operation: `{ P: 2, D: 1, V: 2 }` (source `A[1]`, to `A[2]`).
    *   `operations.push({2, 1, 2})`.
    *   `currentA[1] -= 2` (becomes 1).
    *   `currentA[2] += 2` (becomes 2).
    *   `currentA` is now `[0, 1, 2, 1]`.

*   **`i = 2`:** `currentA[2] = 2`, `B[2] = 3`. `currentA[2] < B[2]` (deficit of 1).
    *   `V = 3 - 2 = 1`.
    *   Operation: `{ P: 4, D: -1, V: 1 }` (source `A[3]`, to `A[2]`).
    *   `operations.push({4, -1, 1})`.
    *   `currentA[2] += 1` (becomes 3).
    *   `currentA[3] -= 1` (becomes 0).
    *   `currentA` is now `[0, 1, 3, 0]`.

*   **Loop finishes.** `currentA` is `[0, 1, 3, 0]`, which matches `B`.
The recorded operations are `(1, 1, 1)`, `(2, 1, 2)`, `(4, -1, 1)`, matching the example output.

This greedy strategy correctly solves the problem given the implicit guarantees of the constraints.
