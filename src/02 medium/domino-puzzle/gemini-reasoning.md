The puzzle asks us to simulate a chain reaction of falling dominoes on a square grid and count how many remain standing. The initial push is always at the top-left corner `(0,0)`.

**Understanding Domino Behavior**

Each domino piece has a type (`|`, `-`, `\`, `/`) and specific rules for:
1.  **From where it can be hit:** If a domino is hit from an invalid direction, it doesn't fall.
2.  **How it falls:** It falls in the opposite direction from which it was hit.
3.  **What it hits:** When a domino falls, it hits other dominoes in the direction(s) it falls. The crucial detail is that the hit on the *next* domino originates from the direction the current domino fell *from* relative to the target. For single-hit dominoes (`|`, `-`), this is straightforward. For diagonal dominoes (`\`, `/`), they can hit up to three adjacent cells.

**Key Definitions and Data Structures:**

*   **Grid:** A 2D array (`string[][]`) to store the map of dominoes.
*   **Fallen Status:** A 2D boolean array (`boolean[][]`) to track which dominoes have already fallen. This prevents infinite loops and ensures each domino falls only once.
*   **Queue for Simulation:** A Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach is ideal. The queue will store objects like `{ r: number, c: number, hit_from_dr: number, hit_from_dc: number }`.
    *   `(r, c)`: The coordinates of the domino that has just fallen.
    *   `(hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc)`: This represents the vector from the domino that *caused* the current domino to fall, *to* the current domino. This is critical for determining the fall direction and subsequent hits. For example, if a domino at `(r,c)` is hit by a domino at `(r-1,c)` (from above), then `hit_from_dr = r - (r-1) = 1` and `hit_from_dc = c - c = 0`. So, `[1,0]` which is `DOWN`.

*   **Direction Vectors:** We define constant `[dr, dc]` arrays for standard directions (Up, Down, Left, Right, and diagonals) to make coordinate calculations clear.
    *   `DIRS.U = [-1, 0]` (Up)
    *   `DIRS.D = [1, 0]` (Down)
    *   `DIRS.L = [0, -1]` (Left)
    *   `DIRS.R = [0, 1]` (Right)
    *   `DIRS.UL = [-1, -1]` (Up-Left)
    *   `DIRS.UR = [-1, 1]` (Up-Right)
    *   `DIRS.DL = [1, -1]` (Down-Left)
    *   `DIRS.DR = [1, 1]` (Down-Right)

*   **`getInverseDir(dr, dc)`:** A helper function that returns `[-dr, -dc]`. If `[dr, dc]` is the `hit_from` direction (from source to target), then `getInverseDir` gives the direction the target domino will *fall*.

*   **`dominoBehaviors` Map:** An object that maps each domino character (`|`, `-`, `\`, `/`) to an object defining its `validHitFrom` directions and a `getHitTargets` function.
    *   `validHitFrom`: A `Set<string>` containing `dirKey(dr, dc)` strings for all valid `hit_from` directions. If a domino is hit from a direction not in this set, it doesn't fall.
    *   `getHitTargets(r, c, hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc, dominoChar)`: This function calculates which adjacent cells the current falling domino will hit. It also determines the `hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc` vector for each *target* domino. This is the vector from the *current* falling domino to the *target* domino.

**Detailed Logic for `getHitTargets`:**

Let `[fall_dr, fall_dc]` be the direction the current domino falls (calculated as the inverse of `[hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc]`).

*   **`|` (Vertical Domino):**
    *   Falls in `[fall_dr, fall_dc]` direction.
    *   Hits only one cell: `(r + fall_dr, c + fall_dc)`.
    *   The `hit_from` direction for the target domino is `[fall_dr, fall_dc]` (because the current domino is hitting it from that relative direction).

*   **`-` (Horizontal Domino):**
    *   Same as `|`. Falls in `[fall_dr, fall_dc]` direction and hits one cell.

*   **`\` (Diagonal, Top-Left to Bottom-Right):**
    *   "Can hit something to its left and downwards, or its right and upwards, including the diagonal place in those directions."
    *   This implies two modes of hitting (L,D,DL or R,U,UR), chosen based on the `[fall_dr, fall_dc]` vector:
        *   If `fall_dr > 0` (falls Down) OR `fall_dc < 0` (falls Left): It falls "towards" its left-down side. It will hit `L, D, DL` relative positions.
        *   Otherwise (falls Up, Right, Up-Right, Up-Left): It falls "towards" its right-up side. It will hit `R, U, UR` relative positions.
    *   For each relative target `[hit_dr_rel, hit_dc_rel]`, the actual target coordinates are `(r + hit_dr_rel, c + hit_dc_rel)`.
    *   The `hit_from` direction for the target domino is `[hit_dr_rel, hit_dc_rel]` (vector from current domino to target).

*   **`/` (Diagonal, Top-Right to Bottom-Left):**
    *   "Can hit something to its left and upwards, or its right and downwards, including the diagonal place in those directions."
    *   Similar logic to `\`, but with different conditions for the two modes:
        *   If `fall_dr > 0` (falls Down) OR `fall_dc > 0` (falls Right): It falls "towards" its right-down side. It will hit `R, D, DR` relative positions.
        *   Otherwise (falls Up, Left, Up-Left, Down-Left): It falls "towards" its left-up side. It will hit `L, U, UL` relative positions.
    *   The `hit_from` direction for the target domino is `[hit_dr_rel, hit_dc_rel]`.

**Initial Push:**

The first domino at `(0,0)` is special. Its "hit from" direction is determined by how it is described to fall:
*   If `|` (vertical): falls to the right. This implies it was hit from its left. The vector from the imaginary source `(0,-1)` to `(0,0)` is `[0,1]` (Right). So, `initialHitFromDr = 0, initialHitFromDc = 1`.
*   If `-` (horizontal): falls downwards. This implies it was hit from its top. The vector from the imaginary source `(-1,0)` to `(0,0)` is `[1,0]` (Down). So, `initialHitFromDr = 1, initialHitFromDc = 0`.
*   If `/` (diagonal): falls downwards and to the right. This implies it was hit from its top-left. The vector from the imaginary source `(-1,-1)` to `(0,0)` is `[1,1]` (Down-Right). So, `initialHitFromDr = 1, initialHitFromDc = 1`.
*   The problem states the first piece will never be `\`.

**Simulation Process (BFS):**

1.  Read `N` and the grid.
2.  Initialize `standingCount` to the total number of non-`.` dominoes.
3.  Initialize `fallen` array to all `false`.
4.  Handle the initial push:
    *   If `grid[0][0]` is not `.` (empty), mark it as fallen (`fallen[0][0] = true`), decrement `standingCount`, and add it to the queue with its special `initialHitFromDr, initialHitFromDc`.
5.  Process the queue:
    *   Dequeue a domino `(r, c)` and its `(hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc)`.
    *   Retrieve its `dominoBehavior`.
    *   **Check `validHitFrom`**: If the `(hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc)` is not in `dominoBehavior.validHitFrom`, this hit is ineffective, and the domino does not fall further. Continue to the next item in the queue.
    *   **Determine `getHitTargets`**: Call `dominoBehavior.getHitTargets(r, c, hit_from_dr, hit_from_dc, dominoType)` to get a list of cells this domino affects.
    *   For each target `(next_r, next_c)`:
        *   Check if `(next_r, next_c)` is within grid bounds.
        *   Check if `grid[next_r][next_c]` is a domino (not `.`) AND it hasn't fallen yet (`!fallen[next_r][next_c]`).
        *   If both conditions are true, mark `fallen[next_r][next_c] = true`, decrement `standingCount`, and enqueue this target domino with its corresponding `next_hit_from_dr, next_hit_from_dc`.
6.  Once the queue is empty, `standingCount` holds the final answer.

This robust BFS approach ensures all chain reactions are correctly simulated, respecting the specific rules for each domino type and hit direction.
