The puzzle asks us to solve a 16x16 Sudoku grid. The crucial part of the problem description is that a "brute-force backtracking" solution will not pass within the time limit, and we need to add "smartness" to the backtracking. This implies using heuristics to guide the search.

The core of a Sudoku solver is a backtracking algorithm.

**Backtracking Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Find an empty cell:** If no empty cells are found, the puzzle is solved.
2.  **Try values:** For the chosen empty cell, iterate through all possible values (A-P, or 0-15 in our internal representation).
3.  **Check validity:** For each value, check if placing it in the current cell violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, or 4x4 block uniqueness).
4.  **Place and recurse:** If a value is valid, place it, and recursively call the solver.
5.  **Success or Backtrack:**
    *   If the recursive call returns `true` (meaning a solution was found down that path), propagate `true` up.
    *   If the recursive call returns `false` (meaning no solution was found down that path), undo the placement (backtrack) and try the next possible value for the current cell.
6.  **No solution:** If all values have been tried for the current cell and none lead to a solution, return `false`.

**Adding "Smartness" (Heuristics):**

The most common and effective heuristic for Sudoku is the **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** heuristic, also known as Most Constrained Variable.

*   **MRV:** Instead of picking the first available empty cell, we pick the empty cell that has the *fewest* possible valid values. The intuition is that this cell is the "most constrained" and should be filled first. If it leads to a contradiction (0 possible values), we detect it earlier, allowing for faster backtracking and pruning of the search tree.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Grid Representation:**
    *   The 16x16 grid will be represented as a `number[][]` where A-P are mapped to 0-15, and `.` (empty) is represented by -1.
    *   We'll use `Map` and `Array` for efficient character-to-number and number-to-character conversions.

2.  **Constraint Tracking:**
    To efficiently check if a number can be placed at a specific cell without violating Sudoku rules, we'll use three boolean 2D arrays:
    *   `rowTracker[row][value]`: `true` if `value` is already present in `row`.
    *   `colTracker[col][value]`: `true` if `value` is already present in `col`.
    *   `blockTracker[blockIndex][value]`: `true` if `value` is already present in the 4x4 block identified by `blockIndex`.
    These trackers are updated whenever a number is placed or removed, allowing `O(1)` checks for validity.

3.  **`getBlockIndex(row, col)`:** Helper function to calculate the 4x4 block index for a given `(row, col)`. For a 16x16 grid with 4x4 blocks, `blockIndex = floor(row / 4) * 4 + floor(col / 4)`.

4.  **`findNextEmptyCellMRV()`:** This function iterates through all empty cells (identified by `currentGrid[r][c] === -1`). For each empty cell, it counts how many values (0-15) can *currently* be placed there using the `canPlace` helper. It returns the `[row, col]` of the cell with the minimum count. If a cell has 0 possible values, it's an immediate dead-end for the current path, so we return that cell quickly to trigger backtracking.

5.  **`emptyCellList`:** We will pre-populate a list of `[row, col]` coordinates for all empty cells encountered in the initial input. This list is not modified during backtracking; `findNextEmptyCellMRV` simply checks `currentGrid[r][c] === -1` to see if a cell in this list is still empty. This avoids costly array splice operations.

**Overall Structure:**

The solution will consist of:
*   Constants for grid size, characters, and mappings.
*   Global state variables for the current grid and the constraint trackers.
*   Helper functions: `getBlockIndex`, `canPlace`, `placeValue`, `removeValue`.
*   The MRV heuristic function: `findNextEmptyCellMRV`.
*   The main recursive backtracking function: `solveSudoku`.
*   The main execution logic to read input, initialize the state, call `solveSudoku`, and print the result.

This approach balances efficiency with reasonable complexity, fitting the problem's requirements.
