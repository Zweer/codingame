The puzzle requires sorting a list of integers based on the alphabetical order of their standard-form Roman numeral representations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1.  **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The core of this puzzle is accurately converting integers to their standard-form Roman numerals. Standard form includes specific subtractive notations like `IV` (4), `IX` (9), `XL` (40), `XC` (90), `CD` (400), and `CM` (900). A common way to implement this is to have a map of values and their corresponding Roman symbols, ordered from largest to smallest. Then, iterate through this map, repeatedly appending the symbol and subtracting its value from the number until the number is processed.

    *   For example, to convert `49`:
        *   `49 >= 40 (XL)`: Append `XL`, `num` becomes `9`.
        *   `9 >= 9 (IX)`: Append `IX`, `num` becomes `0`.
        *   Result: `XLIX`. This handles the `49 = XLIX, not IL` rule.

2.  **Data Structure**: To facilitate sorting, we need to store both the original integer and its Roman numeral representation. An array of objects, where each object contains `original: number` and `roman: string`, is suitable.

3.  **Sorting**: Once all integers are converted and stored with their Roman equivalents, sort this array of objects. The sorting criteria will be the `roman` string property, using standard alphabetical (lexicographical) comparison. In JavaScript/TypeScript, the `String.prototype.localeCompare()` method is ideal for this.

4.  **Output**: After sorting, extract the `original` integer values from the sorted array and join them with spaces for the final output.

**Example Clarification**:
The problem statement includes a potentially confusing example for `44, 63, 97`.
*   `44 = XLIV`
*   `63 = LXIII`
*   `97 = XCVII`

If sorted strictly alphabetically:
*   `XLIV` (starts with X, then L)
*   `XCVII` (starts with X, then C)
*   `LXIII` (starts with L)

Comparing `XLIV` and `XCVII`: 'L' comes before 'C', so `XLIV` comes before `XCVII`.
Therefore, the alphabetical order is `XLIV`, `XCVII`, `LXIII`.
The corresponding output should be `44 97 63`.

However, the problem example states the output is `63 97 44`, and provides an explanation that `LXIII` is 1st, `XCVII` is 2nd, `XLIV` is 3rd. This order (`LXIII`, `XCVII`, `XLIV`) is *not* standard alphabetical.

The second example in the problem, `1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000`, with output `100 500 1 50 1000 5 10`, *perfectly matches* standard alphabetical sorting:
*   C (100)
*   D (500)
*   I (1)
*   L (50)
*   M (1000)
*   V (5)
*   X (10)

Given the ambiguity, the most robust approach for "alphabetical order" is to use standard lexicographical string comparison (`localeCompare`). This approach correctly handles the second example, which seems to be the most consistent.

**Constraints**:
*   `1 <= n <= 20`: The number of integers is very small, so efficiency of sorting is not a major concern.
*   `1 <= x <= 3999`: The `toRoman` function must handle this range. Our chosen map and algorithm correctly cover this.
