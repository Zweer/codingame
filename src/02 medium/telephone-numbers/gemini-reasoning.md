The problem asks us to count the number of "elements" required to store a list of telephone numbers, where common prefixes should not be duplicated. This is a classic application of a Trie (also known as a prefix tree) data structure.

### Reasoning

1.  **Trie Structure**: A Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a digit (or character), and the path from the root to a node represents a prefix of a stored number. Edges between nodes indicate the next digit in the sequence.
2.  **Storage Optimization**: By sharing common prefixes, the Trie naturally optimizes storage. For example, if "01234" and "01256" are stored, the "012" part is represented by a single path of three nodes, and then they branch off.
3.  **Counting Elements**: The problem defines an "element" as a number (digit) stored in the structure. In the context of a Trie, this means every time we create a *new* node to extend a path for a digit, we count it as one element. If a digit in a phone number leads to an already existing node, no new element is added for that digit.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize**:
    *   Create a `TrieNode` class. Each `TrieNode` will have a `children` property, which is a map (or dictionary) where keys are digits ('0'-'9') and values are other `TrieNode` instances.
    *   Initialize an empty `root` node for the Trie.
    *   Initialize `totalElements = 0`. This variable will store our final count.
2.  **Process Phone Numbers**:
    *   Read the total number of phone numbers, `N`.
    *   Loop `N` times:
        *   For each phone number:
            *   Start traversing the Trie from the `root` node. Let `currentNode` be `root`.
            *   For each `digit` in the phone number:
                *   Check if `currentNode.children` already contains an entry for the current `digit`.
                *   If it *does not* exist:
                    *   Create a `newNode`.
                    *   Add `newNode` to `currentNode.children` with the current `digit` as the key.
                    *   Increment `totalElements` by 1 (because we just added a new element/node to the structure).
                *   Move `currentNode` to the child node corresponding to the `digit` (whether it was newly created or already existed).
3.  **Output**: After processing all phone numbers, `totalElements` will hold the total number of elements stored. Print this value.

Initial `totalElements = 0`. `root` is an empty Trie node.

1.  **`0412578440`**:
    *   `0`: New node. `totalElements = 1`. `currentNode` points to node `0`.
    *   `4`: New node. `totalElements = 2`. `currentNode` points to node `0-4`.
    *   `1`: New node. `totalElements = 3`. `currentNode` points to node `0-4-1`.
    *   `2`: New node. `totalElements = 4`. `currentNode` points to node `0-4-1-2`.
    *   `5`: New node. `totalElements = 5`.
    *   `7`: New node. `totalElements = 6`.
    *   `8`: New node. `totalElements = 7`.
    *   `4`: New node. `totalElements = 8`.
    *   `4`: New node. `totalElements = 9`.
    *   `0`: New node. `totalElements = 10`.
    (Current `totalElements = 10`)

2.  **`0412199803`**:
    *   `0`: Exists. `currentNode` points to node `0`.
    *   `4`: Exists. `currentNode` points to node `0-4`.
    *   `1`: Exists. `currentNode` points to node `0-4-1`.
    *   `2`: Exists. `currentNode` points to node `0-4-1-2`.
    *   `1`: New node (from `0-4-1-2`). `totalElements = 11`.
    *   `9`: New node. `totalElements = 12`.
    *   `9`: New node. `totalElements = 13`.
    *   `8`: New node. `totalElements = 14`.
    *   `0`: New node. `totalElements = 15`.
    *   `3`: New node. `totalElements = 16`.
    (Current `totalElements = 16`)

3.  **`0468892011`**:
    *   `0`: Exists. `currentNode` points to node `0`.
    *   `4`: Exists. `currentNode` points to node `0-4`.
    *   `6`: New node (from `0-4`). `totalElements = 17`.
    *   `8`: New node. `totalElements = 18`.
    *   `8`: New node. `totalElements = 19`.
    *   `9`: New node. `totalElements = 20`.
    *   `2`: New node. `totalElements = 21`.
    *   `0`: New node. `totalElements = 22`.
    *   `1`: New node. `totalElements = 23`.
    *   `1`: New node. `totalElements = 24`.
    (Current `totalElements = 24`)

4.  **`112`**:
    *   `1`: New node (from root). `totalElements = 25`.
    *   `1`: New node. `totalElements = 26`.
    *   `2`: New node. `totalElements = 27`.
    (Current `totalElements = 27`)

5.  **`15`**:
    *   `1`: Exists (from previous `112`).
    *   `5`: New node (from node `1`). `totalElements = 28`.
    (Current `totalElements = 28`)

Final `totalElements = 28`. This matches the example output.

**Constraints Analysis:**
*   `N` (number of phone numbers) up to 10000.
*   `L` (max length of phone number) up to 20.
*   Time complexity: Each phone number of length `L` involves `L` lookups/insertions in a Map, which is effectively O(1) on average for single-character keys. So, total time complexity is `O(N * L)`. For `10000 * 20 = 200,000` operations, this is extremely fast.
*   Space complexity: In the worst case (no common prefixes), `N * L` nodes would be created. `200,000` nodes, each with a small Map (up to 10 entries) is well within typical memory limits.
