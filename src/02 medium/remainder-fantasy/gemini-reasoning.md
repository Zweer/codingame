The puzzle "Remainder Fantasy" asks us to find the minimum integer `x` that satisfies a set of linear congruences:
`x ≡ r_1 (mod m_1)`
`x ≡ r_2 (mod m_2)`
...
`x ≡ r_N (mod m_N)`

Additionally, the solution `x` must be greater than or equal to all given moduli `m_i`.

**Problem Analysis and Approach:**

1.  **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for Non-Coprime Moduli:** The core of the problem is solving a system of congruences. The standard CRT applies when all moduli (`m_i`) are pairwise coprime. However, the puzzle explicitly states that moduli may not be coprime. In such cases, we use a generalized approach that iteratively combines two congruences at a time.

    Suppose we have a current combined congruence `x ≡ current_x (mod current_modulus)` and we want to combine it with a new congruence `x ≡ r_i (mod m_i)`.
    We look for an `x'` such that `x' = current_x + k * current_modulus` for some integer `k`.
    Substituting this into the second congruence:
    `current_x + k * current_modulus ≡ r_i (mod m_i)`
    Rearranging: `k * current_modulus ≡ r_i - current_x (mod m_i)`

    This is a linear congruence of the form `A * k ≡ B (mod M)`.
    Let `g = gcd(current_modulus, m_i)`.
    For a solution to exist, `(r_i - current_x)` must be divisible by `g`. (The problem usually guarantees consistent inputs).
    If it is, we divide the entire congruence by `g`:
    `k * (current_modulus / g) ≡ (r_i - current_x) / g (mod m_i / g)`
    Now, `(current_modulus / g)` and `(m_i / g)` are coprime. We can find the modular multiplicative inverse of `(current_modulus / g)` modulo `(m_i / g)` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
    Let `k_0` be the smallest non-negative solution for `k`.
    The new particular solution `x'` will be `current_x + k_0 * current_modulus`.
    The new combined modulus will be `lcm(current_modulus, m_i) = (current_modulus * m_i) / g`.
    We then update `current_x` and `current_modulus` with these new values and continue to the next congruence.

2.  **Handling Large Numbers (BigInt):** The problem specifies `0 < x < 2^32` for the final answer. However, intermediate `current_modulus` values (which are LCMs) can potentially exceed JavaScript's safe integer limit (`2^53 - 1`) if the input moduli are large (e.g., close to `2^32`). To prevent precision errors and ensure correctness for all possible inputs, it's safest to use JavaScript's `BigInt` type for all arithmetic operations involving `x`, `m`, and `r`.

3.  **Final Constraint (x ≥ max_m):** After finding the smallest non-negative solution `current_x` and the overall modulus `current_modulus` (which is `lcm(m_1, ..., m_N)`), the general solution is `X = current_x + K * current_modulus` for any integer `K`.
    We need to find the smallest `X` from this general solution such that `X ≥ max_m` (where `max_m` is the largest of all input moduli).
    If `current_x ≥ max_m`, then `current_x` is the answer.
    Otherwise, we repeatedly add `current_modulus` to `current_x` until it becomes greater than or equal to `max_m`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  Initialize `current_x = 0n` (BigInt zero) and `current_modulus = 1n` (BigInt one). This represents the trivial congruence `x ≡ 0 (mod 1)`.
2.  Initialize `max_m = 0n` to track the largest input modulus.
3.  Read the number of conditions `N`.
4.  Loop `N` times for each condition `m_i, r_i`:
    a.  Convert `m_i` and `r_i` to `BigInt`.
    b.  Update `max_m = max(max_m, m_i)`.
    c.  Calculate `g = gcd(current_modulus, m_i)`.
    d.  Calculate `diff = r_i - current_x`.
    e.  If `diff % g !== 0n`, the system is inconsistent (though likely not encountered in test cases).
    f.  Calculate `mod_prime = m_i / g`.
    g.  Calculate `coeff = current_modulus / g`.
    h.  Calculate `target = diff / g`.
    i.  Find `inv = modInverse(coeff, mod_prime)` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
    j.  Calculate `k_0 = (target * inv) % mod_prime`. Ensure `k_0` is non-negative.
    k.  Update `current_x = current_x + k_0 * current_modulus`.
    l.  Update `current_modulus = (current_modulus * m_i) / g` (this is `lcm(current_modulus, m_i)`).
    m.  Normalize `current_x = (current_x % current_modulus + current_modulus) % current_modulus` to keep it the smallest non-negative solution.
5.  After the loop, `current_x` holds the smallest non-negative solution, and `current_modulus` holds the LCM of all moduli.
6.  Apply the final constraint: `final_x = current_x`. While `final_x < max_m`, add `current_modulus` to `final_x`.
7.  Print `final_x.toString()`.
