The puzzle asks us to find the highest-scoring word from a given dictionary that can be formed using a set of 7 available letters. Each letter can be used at most once. If multiple words have the same highest score, the one appearing first in the dictionary should be chosen.

Here's a breakdown of the solution approach:

1.  **Letter Scoring System:** We'll define a map or an object to store the point value for each letter. This allows for quick lookups when calculating word scores.

2.  **Available Letters Tracking:** To efficiently check if a word can be formed from the available letters, we'll first process the 7 given letters into a frequency map (e.g., `Map<string, number>`). This map will store how many times each letter is available.

3.  **`canFormWord` Function:** This is a crucial helper function. Given a word and the available letter counts, it determines if the word can be spelled.
    *   It creates a *copy* of the available letter counts. This is important because we need to "consume" letters from the copy to check the current word without altering the original available letters for subsequent dictionary words.
    *   For each character in the word, it decrements the count of that letter in the copied map.
    *   If at any point, a character's count becomes zero or negative (meaning we don't have enough of that letter), the function immediately returns `false`.
    *   If all characters in the word can be accounted for, it returns `true`.

4.  **`calculateWordScore` Function:** This function takes a word and uses the predefined letter scores to calculate its total point value.

5.  **Main Logic:**
    *   Read the number of words `N` and then all the dictionary words into an array.
    *   Read the 7 available letters and convert them into a frequency map using the `getLetterCounts` helper.
    *   Initialize `bestWord` to an empty string and `maxScore` to a negative value (e.g., -1), as scores are non-negative.
    *   Iterate through each word in the dictionary:
        *   Call `canFormWord` to check if the current dictionary word can be formed from the available letters.
        *   If it can, calculate its score using `calculateWordScore`.
        *   Compare this `currentScore` with `maxScore`. If `currentScore` is greater, update `maxScore` and `bestWord`. The tie-breaking rule (choose the word appearing first in the dictionary) is naturally handled by this check; if a later word has the same score, it won't be greater than `maxScore`, so `bestWord` won't be updated.
    *   Finally, print the `bestWord`.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Reading dictionary: O(N * L), where L is max word length (30).
*   Processing available letters: O(7).
*   Main loop: N iterations.
    *   `canFormWord`: O(L)
    *   `calculateWordScore`: O(L)
*   Total: O(N * L) in the worst case. Given N < 100,000 and L = 30, this is approximately 3 million operations, which is well within typical time limits (usually 1-2 seconds for 10^7 - 10^8 ops).
