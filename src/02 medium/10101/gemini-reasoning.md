## Reasoning

The puzzle asks us to find the maximum number of completed rows and columns after placing a single 2x2 block on a given grid. A 2x2 block can only be placed if all four cells it would occupy are currently empty (represented by '.'). Placing the block means converting these four empty cells to filled cells ('#').

Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Input Processing:**
    *   Read the width `W` and height `H` of the grid.
    *   Read the grid rows. It's beneficial to convert the grid into a more manageable data structure, such as a 2D array of booleans, where `true` represents a filled cell ('#') and `false` represents an empty cell ('.').

2.  **Iterate Possible Placements:**
    *   A 2x2 block needs a top-left corner `(r, c)`.
    *   For a 2x2 block to fit, its top-left corner `(r, c)` must be within the bounds such that `r+1 < H` and `c+1 < W`. This means `r` can range from `0` to `H-2` and `c` can range from `0` to `W-2`.
    *   We will iterate through all possible `(r, c)` pairs within these bounds.

3.  **Check Placement Validity:**
    *   For each potential `(r, c)`, check the four cells that the 2x2 block would occupy: `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+1, c+1)`.
    *   If all four of these cells are currently empty (`false` in our boolean grid), then it's a valid spot to place the block.

4.  **Simulate Placement and Count:**
    *   If a spot is valid, we need to simulate placing the block without affecting the original grid, as we might try other placements later. The easiest way to do this is to create a *deep copy* of the current grid.
    *   In the copied grid, change the four cells at `(r, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r+1, c)`, and `(r+1, c+1)` from `false` to `true`.
    *   Now, count how many rows and columns in this *simulated* grid are completely filled. A row or column is complete if all its cells are `true`. This can be done by iterating through each row and checking if all cells are `true`, then doing the same for each column.
    *   Keep track of the maximum number of completed lines (rows + columns) found across all valid placements.

5.  **Output:**
    *   After checking all possible 2x2 placements, print the `maxCompletedLines` found. If no valid placement was possible, `maxCompletedLines` will remain `0`, which is the correct output in that case.

**Example Walkthrough (from puzzle description):**

Grid:
```
..#
..#
##.
W=3, H=3
```

Boolean grid (`F` for '.', `T` for '#'):
```
[[F, F, T],
 [F, F, T],
 [T, T, F]]
```

Possible top-left corners for a 2x2 block:
*   `(0,0)`: Cells `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)` are all `F`. Valid!
    *   Simulate placing block:
        ```
        [[T, T, T],  <- Row 0 completed
         [T, T, T],  <- Row 1 completed
         [T, T, F]]
        ```
    *   Count completed lines:
        *   Row 0: `[T,T,T]` - Complete (1)
        *   Row 1: `[T,T,T]` - Complete (2)
        *   Row 2: `[T,T,F]` - Incomplete
        *   Column 0: `[T,T,T]` - Complete (3)
        *   Column 1: `[T,T,T]` - Complete (4)
        *   Column 2: `[T,T,F]` - Incomplete
    *   Total completed: 4. `maxCompletedLines` becomes 4.

*   `(0,1)`: Cells `(0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2)`. Cell `(0,2)` is `T` ('#'). Invalid.
*   `(1,0)`: Cells `(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)`. Cell `(2,0)` is `T` ('#'). Invalid.
*   `(1,1)`: Cells `(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)`. Cell `(1,2)` is `T` ('#'). Invalid.

No other valid placements. The maximum completed lines found is 4.

The constraints `W, H <= 10` mean the grid is very small, so this brute-force approach of checking all possibilities and simulating each one is highly efficient and will run well within time limits.
