The problem requires finding the temperature closest to zero from a given list of temperatures. There's a specific tie-breaking rule: if two temperatures are equally close to zero (e.g., -5 and 5), the positive one should be chosen. If no temperatures are provided, the output should be 0.

Here's the reasoning for the chosen solution:

1.  **Read `N`**: The first line provides `N`, the number of temperatures. We can read this using `readline()` and convert it to a number using the unary plus operator `+`, which is concise.
2.  **Handle `N = 0`**: If `N` is 0, no temperatures are provided. The problem explicitly states to output `0` in this case. The condition `!n` concisely checks if `n` is 0.
3.  **Process Temperatures (if `N > 0`)**:
    *   Read the second line, which contains space-separated temperatures.
    *   `split(' ')` converts the string into an array of strings.
    *   `map(Number)` converts each string temperature into a number. This creates an array of numeric temperatures.
    *   **Finding the closest using `reduce()`**: The `reduce()` array method is perfect for this. It iterates through the array and accumulates a single result based on a provided callback function.
        *   The `reduce` callback takes two arguments: `a` (the accumulator, which holds the current "closest temperature found so far") and `b` (the current temperature being evaluated).
        *   Inside the callback, we compare `b` with `a`:
            *   `Math.abs(b) < Math.abs(a)`: If the absolute value of `b` is strictly less than the absolute value of `a`, `b` is closer to zero, so we return `b`.
            *   `Math.abs(b) == Math.abs(a) && b > a`: If the absolute values are equal (a tie), we check if `b` is greater than `a`. This handles the tie-breaking rule: if one is negative and the other is positive (e.g., -5 and 5), `b > a` will be true for `b = 5, a = -5`. In this case, we prefer the positive one, so we return `b`.
            *   Otherwise (if `b` is not closer and not preferred in a tie), we keep `a`.
        *   The `reduce` method automatically uses the first element of the array as the initial `a` (accumulator) and starts iterating from the second element. This works perfectly as we need to initialize our search with one of the temperatures.

This approach is concise and correctly implements all the problem's rules.
