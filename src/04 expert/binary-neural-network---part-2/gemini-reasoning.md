The problem asks us to build a neural network with 8 inputs and 8 outputs capable of solving a set of binary classification tasks. This is a follow-up to "Binary neural network - Part 1", implying a similar structure but potentially a more complex underlying pattern. The core of the solution will be a feedforward neural network trained using backpropagation.

### Neural Network Design

1.  **Architecture**:
    *   **Input Layer**: 8 nodes, corresponding to the 8 bits of the input binary string.
    *   **Output Layer**: 8 nodes, corresponding to the 8 bits of the output binary string.
    *   **Hidden Layers**: This is the main point of experimentation. For binary classification problems where outputs are either all 0s or all 1s (as suggested by the example), a single hidden layer is often sufficient to learn non-linear relationships. We will start with one hidden layer.
        *   The number of nodes in the hidden layer is a hyperparameter. A common heuristic is to choose a value between the input and output layer sizes, or a multiple of them. Since the problem implies increased complexity from Part 1, we opt for a moderate number of nodes (e.g., 32). This allows the network to learn more complex features than just simple linear combinations.

2.  **Activation Function**:
    *   The Sigmoid function (`1 / (1 + e^(-x))`) is ideal for binary outputs, as it squashes values between 0 and 1, which can then be rounded to 0 or 1. Its derivative (`x * (1 - x)`) is also simple to compute, which is necessary for backpropagation.

3.  **Training Algorithm**:
    *   **Feedforward**: Calculate the output of each neuron from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer.
    *   **Backpropagation**:
        *   Calculate the error at the output layer (difference between predicted and expected output).
        *   Propagate this error backward through the network, calculating the "delta" (error gradient) for each neuron.
        *   Use these deltas to adjust the weights and biases of each neuron using gradient descent.
    *   **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is implicitly minimized during backpropagation.

4.  **Hyperparameters for Training**:
    *   **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size during weight updates. Too high, and the network might overshoot the optimal weights or become unstable. Too low, and training will be very slow. A common starting point is 0.1 or 0.05. We'll use 0.05 for stability.
    *   **Epochs (Training Iterations)**: The number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the network. More epochs allow the network to learn more, but too many can lead to overfitting. We'll start with 50,000 epochs, which is a reasonable number for training data sizes often found in CodinGame puzzles.

### Data Handling

*   Input and output are 8-digit binary strings (e.g., "01111010"). These need to be converted into arrays of numbers (0 or 1) for the neural network.
*   The network's output will be an array of floating-point numbers between 0 and 1. These need to be rounded (e.g., `Math.round`) to 0 or 1 and then joined back into an 8-digit binary string.

### Problem Specific Logic (Inferred from Example)

By inspecting the provided example inputs and outputs, a strong pattern emerges:
*   Inputs with 0, 1, 2, or 3 set bits (ones) map to `00000000`.
*   Inputs with 4, 5, 6, or 7 set bits map to `11111111`. (No 8-bit inputs with all 8 ones were shown, but this threshold pattern holds).

This "count set bits" logic is a relatively simple thresholding function. A neural network, especially with a hidden layer, is well-equipped to learn such a function. The chosen architecture (8 inputs, 32 hidden nodes, 8 outputs) and training parameters (`learningRate=0.05`, `epochs=50000`) should be sufficient to learn this pattern effectively and generalize to new inputs.

### Code Structure

The code is organized into three main classes:
1.  `Neuron`: Represents a single neuron with weights, bias, activation function (sigmoid), and its derivative.
2.  `Layer`: A collection of `Neuron` objects, responsible for performing feedforward for all its neurons.
3.  `NeuralNetwork`: Manages the layers, handles the overall feedforward pass, and implements the backpropagation training algorithm.

Utility functions are provided for converting binary strings to number arrays and vice-versa.
