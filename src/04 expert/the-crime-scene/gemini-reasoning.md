The problem asks us to calculate the minimum number of 5-foot rolls of police line needed to enclose all clue locations, with an additional requirement that all clues must be at least 3 feet from the police line at all points.

**Core Idea:**

1.  **Enclosing all clues:** The smallest area that can enclose a set of points is defined by their **convex hull**. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the given points.
2.  **3-foot buffer:** If the police line must be at least 3 feet away from *all* clues, this means we effectively need to expand the convex hull outwards by 3 feet.

Consider the geometry of this expansion:
*   Each edge of the convex hull will be extended outwards by 3 feet, parallel to the original edge. The length of this segment remains the same as the original edge.
*   At each vertex of the convex hull, the police line will curve around the corner. If you sum up the angles of these curves (which are related to the external angles of the polygon), they will always add up to a full circle (360 degrees or 2π radians). This means the total length added by these curves around all vertices is equivalent to the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the buffer distance.

Therefore, the total length of police line required is:
`Perimeter (Convex Hull) + Circumference of a circle with radius 3`

The circumference of a circle with radius `r` is `2 * π * r`. In this case, `r = 3`, so the added length is `2 * π * 3 = 6π` feet.

**Steps to Solve:**

1.  **Read Input:** Read the number of clues `N` and then `N` sets of `(x, y)` coordinates.
2.  **Compute Convex Hull:** Use an efficient algorithm to find the convex hull of the given points. The Monotone Chain (or Andrew's Algorithm) is suitable, as it has a time complexity of O(N log N) due to sorting, which is efficient enough for N up to 100,000.
    *   Sort all points lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate).
    *   Build the upper hull by iterating through the sorted points and maintaining a stack of points that form a counter-clockwise turn. If adding a new point causes a non-counter-clockwise turn (a right turn or collinear), pop points from the stack until a counter-clockwise turn is restored.
    *   Build the lower hull by iterating through the sorted points in reverse order and applying the same logic.
    *   Combine the upper and lower hulls to form the complete convex hull, ensuring no duplicate points and maintaining counter-clockwise order.
3.  **Calculate Perimeter of Convex Hull:** Sum the Euclidean distances between consecutive points on the computed convex hull. Remember to connect the last point back to the first point to close the polygon.
    *   The distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.
4.  **Add Buffer Length:** Add `6 * π` to the convex hull perimeter.
5.  **Calculate Rolls:** Divide the total required length by 5 (the length of one roll) and round the result *up* to the nearest integer using `Math.ceil()`, because Sharelock must buy whole rolls.

**Edge Cases Handled by the Algorithm:**

*   **N = 0, 1, or 2 points:** The `convexHull` function correctly handles these cases by returning all input points. The perimeter calculation then works as expected (0 for 0-1 points, 2 * distance for 2 points forming a line segment).
*   **Collinear points:** The Monotone Chain algorithm, with the `crossProduct <= 0` condition, naturally removes intermediate collinear points, keeping only the extreme ones on a segment. This ensures the shortest perimeter is calculated for collinear sets.

**Cross Product Explanation:**

The `crossProduct(o, a, b)` function calculates `(a.x - o.x) * (b.y - o.y) - (a.y - o.y) * (b.x - o.x)`. This is the 2D cross product of vectors `OA` and `OB`.
*   If `> 0`, `OB` is counter-clockwise (left turn) relative to `OA`.
*   If `< 0`, `OB` is clockwise (right turn) relative to `OA`.
*   If `= 0`, `O`, `A`, `B` are collinear.

In the Monotone Chain algorithm, we want to maintain a sequence of points that always make a "left turn" (counter-clockwise) to form the outer boundary. If adding a new point `P_new` to the sequence `P_prev -> P_current` results in a right turn (`crossProduct(P_prev, P_current, P_new) < 0`) or a collinear segment (`crossProduct(...) == 0`), then `P_current` is not part of the convex hull's "outermost" boundary and should be removed (`pop()`) from the stack. This is why the condition `crossProduct(...) <= 0` triggers a pop.
