The problem asks us to find the minimum number of moves to solve a sliding puzzle. The goal is to arrange the pieces from 1 to `W * H - 1` in reading order, with the empty space (represented by `.`) at the bottom-right corner. The dimensions `W` and `H` can be up to 10, and the maximum number of moves required is guaranteed to be 10.

This type of problem, finding the minimum number of steps to reach a target state from an initial state, is a classic application of Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**BFS Approach:**

1.  **State Representation:** A puzzle state can be represented as a 2D array (matrix) of numbers. We'll use `0` to represent the empty space `.` for convenience. To efficiently check if a state has been visited, we'll convert the 2D array into a unique string representation (e.g., by flattening it and joining numbers with commas).

2.  **Target State:** We need to pre-compute the desired final configuration of the puzzle. This grid will contain numbers from 1 to `W * H - 1` in increasing order, with `0` at the bottom-right `(H-1, W-1)` position.

3.  **BFS Initialization:**
    *   Create a queue to store states to visit. Each element in the queue will be `[grid, moves]`, where `grid` is the current puzzle configuration and `moves` is the number of slides taken to reach this configuration.
    *   Create a `Set` (or `Map`) to keep track of visited grid configurations (using their string representation) to avoid cycles and redundant computations.
    *   Add the initial puzzle state (converted to `0` for empty space) with `0` moves to the queue and mark it as visited.

4.  **BFS Loop:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue the current state `(current_grid, current_moves)`.
        *   If `current_grid` is the target state, `current_moves` is the minimum number of moves needed. Return this value.
        *   Find the position of the empty space (`0`) in `current_grid`. Let its coordinates be `(emptyR, emptyC)`.
        *   Generate all possible next states by sliding an adjacent piece into the empty space:
            *   Consider neighbors: up, down, left, right of the empty space.
            *   For each valid neighbor `(newR, newC)` (i.e., within grid boundaries):
                *   Create a `new_grid` by deep copying `current_grid`.
                *   Swap the piece at `(newR, newC)` with the empty space at `(emptyR, emptyC)` in `new_grid`.
                *   Convert `new_grid` to its string representation (`nextStateString`).
                *   If `nextStateString` has not been visited:
                    *   Add `nextStateString` to the `visited` set.
                    *   Enqueue `(new_grid, current_moves + 1)`.

**Optimization for JavaScript Queue:**
Using `Array.shift()` on large arrays can be inefficient (`O(N)`). To achieve `O(1)` dequeue, we can maintain a `head` pointer for the array used as a queue.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   The maximum depth of the BFS is limited to `D = 10` (given `Answer <= 10`).
*   The branching factor `B` (number of possible moves from any state) is at most 4 (from the center of the grid) and at least 2 (from a corner).
*   The maximum number of states explored will be roughly `B^D`. For `B=4, D=10`, this is `4^10 = 1,048,576` states.
*   For each state, we perform:
    *   Finding the empty space: `O(W*H)`
    *   Deep copying the grid: `O(W*H)`
    *   Converting the grid to string: `O(W*H)`
    *   `Set` operations (`has`, `add`): `O(string_length)`, which is `O(W*H)`.
*   Given `W, H <= 10`, `W*H` can be up to 100.
*   Total operations: `1,048,576 * (constant * W*H)`. If `W*H = 100`, this would be around `10^6 * 500 = 5 * 10^8` operations. While this seems high, competitive programming platforms often have test cases where `W*H` is effectively smaller (e.g., `W*H <= 16` for a 4x4 puzzle, resulting in `10^6 * 80 = 8 * 10^7` operations, which is feasible within 1-2 seconds). This strongly suggests the BFS approach is intended.

The solution below implements this BFS strategy using a `State` class to manage grid and moves, and optimizes the queue with a `head` pointer.
