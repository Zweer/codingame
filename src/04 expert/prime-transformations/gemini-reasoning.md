The problem asks us to transform an integer `X` based on a set of prime-to-prime mappings. We are given `C` clues, where each clue `(Ai, Bi)` indicates that the number `Ai` transforms into `Bi`. The core idea is that if `N = P1^Q1 * P2^Q2 * ...`, then its transformed value `N'` will be `P1'^Q1 * P2'^Q2 * ...`, where `Pi'` is the transformed prime for `Pi`. A crucial constraint is that all prime factors `Pi` involved in any number's factorization (including `X`, `Ai`, and `Bi`) are between 2 and 100. Also, the transformation maps primes such that "no two primes map to the same prime".

Here's the breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Prime Precomputation:** Since all prime factors are `<= 100`, we can precompute all prime numbers up to 100 using a sieve (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes). This small set of primes will be used for all factorizations.

2.  **Prime Factorization Function:** We need a function `primeFactorize(n: BigInt)` that takes a `BigInt` (due to the `2^63` constraint) and returns a `Map<BigInt, number>` representing its prime factorization (e.g., `96 -> {2: 5, 3: 1}`). This function iterates through our precomputed primes, dividing `n` by each prime repeatedly to find its exponent.

3.  **Deducing the Prime Transformation Map:** This is the most complex part. We need to build a `primeMap: Map<BigInt, BigInt>` where keys are original primes and values are their transformed primes. We also maintain a `reversePrimeMap: Map<BigInt, BigInt>` to ensure that no two original primes map to the same target prime ("no two primes map to the same prime").

    The deduction works iteratively:
    *   Initialize `primeMap` and `reversePrimeMap` as empty.
    *   Store all `C` clues as factorized pairs: `[factorsA, factorsB]`.
    *   Enter a `do-while` loop that continues as long as new prime mappings are found in a pass.
        *   In each pass, iterate through the `clues`. For each clue `(Ai, Bi)`:
            *   Factorize `Ai` into `factorsA` and `Bi` into `factorsB`.
            *   **Consistency Check & Direct Deduction:**
                *   For each prime `pA` with exponent `expA` in `factorsA`:
                    *   If `pA` is already in `primeMap` (meaning we've already deduced its mapping), say `pA -> pB_expected`, then verify that `pB_expected` exists in `factorsB` with the same exponent `expA`. If this holds, `pB_expected` is considered "used" for this clue. If not, this clue is inconsistent or cannot be fully resolved in this pass.
                    *   If `pA` is not yet in `primeMap`: Find potential `pB` candidates from `factorsB` that have the same exponent `expA`, haven't been used yet within this clue, and are not already targets in the `reversePrimeMap`.
                        *   If only one such `pB` candidate exists, this is a unique deduction: `pA` must map to `pB`. Add this to a temporary `potentialLocalMappings` for the current clue. Mark `pB` as "used" locally.
                        *   If no `pB` candidate exists, this clue is problematic or cannot be resolved.
                        *   If multiple `pB` candidates exist (ambiguity), this clue cannot be fully resolved in this pass.
            *   **Applying Deductions:** If all prime factors in `factorsA` could be either confirmed consistent with `primeMap` or uniquely deduced in this pass (without any ambiguity), then apply the `potentialLocalMappings` to the global `primeMap` and `reversePrimeMap`. Mark `newMappingsFoundThisPass = true`.
            *   Clues that caused inconsistency, couldn't be fully resolved, or were ambiguous are put back into a `cluesToKeepForNextPass` list to be processed again in the next iteration.
        *   The loop terminates when a full pass yields no new prime mappings.

4.  **Transforming X:**
    *   Factorize `X` into `factorsX`.
    *   Initialize `Y = 1n`.
    *   For each prime `p` with exponent `exp` in `factorsX`:
        *   Look up `p` in the `primeMap`.
        *   If `p` is found, use its transformed value `p_transformed = primeMap.get(p)!`.
        *   If `p` is not found (meaning no clue involved it), it implies `p` maps to itself: `p_transformed = p`.
        *   Multiply `Y` by `(p_transformed ** BigInt(exp))`.

5.  **Output:** Print the final `Y` value.

**Example Walkthrough (Input: 16, Clue: 2 5):**
1.  `X = 16n`, `C = 1`.
2.  Clue: `Ai = 2n`, `Bi = 5n`.
    *   `primeFactorize(2n)` gives `{2: 1}`.
    *   `primeFactorize(5n)` gives `{5: 1}`.
    *   `clues = [[{2:1}, {5:1}]]`.
3.  **Deduction Loop - Pass 1:**
    *   Process `[{2:1}, {5:1}]`.
    *   `pA = 2n`, `expA = 1`. `primeMap` is empty.
    *   Candidates for `pB` in `{5:1}` matching `expA=1` are just `5n`.
    *   This is a unique match: `2n` maps to `5n`.
    *   Apply this mapping: `primeMap.set(2n, 5n)`, `reversePrimeMap.set(5n, 2n)`. `newMappingsFoundThisPass = true`.
    *   This clue is fully resolved; it's not put back into `cluesToKeepForNextPass`.
    *   End of pass. `newMappingsFoundThisPass` is true, so loop continues.
4.  **Deduction Loop - Pass 2:**
    *   `clues` is now empty. `newMappingsFoundThisPass` becomes `false`. Loop terminates.
5.  **Transform X=16:**
    *   `primeFactorize(16n)` gives `{2: 4}`.
    *   `Y = 1n`.
    *   For `p=2n, exp=4`: `primeMap.has(2n)` is true, `primeMap.get(2n)` is `5n`.
    *   `p_transformed = 5n`.
    *   `Y = 1n * (5n ** 4n) = 1n * 625n = 625n`.
6.  Output: `625`.

This approach systematically builds the `primeMap` and correctly handles the constraints and the iterative nature of deducing mappings from numerical clues.
