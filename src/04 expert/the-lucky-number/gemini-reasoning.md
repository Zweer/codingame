The problem asks us to count "lucky numbers" within a given range `[L, R]`. A lucky number is defined as a 10-based number that contains at least one '6' or at least one '8', but not both '6' and '8' simultaneously. The constraints `1 <= L <= R <= 10^18` indicate that a direct iteration through the range is not feasible. This calls for a digit DP (Dynamic Programming) approach.

The standard way to solve range queries `[L, R]` with digit DP is to calculate `count(R) - count(L-1)`, where `count(X)` is the number of lucky numbers from 1 to `X`.

**Digit DP State Definition:**

We define a recursive function `dfs(index, tight, has6, has8, isStarted)`:
- `index`: The current digit position we are considering, from left to right (0-indexed).
- `tight`: A boolean flag. If `true`, it means we are currently constructing a number whose prefix matches the prefix of the input number `N` (converted to string `S`). This restricts the upper bound for the current digit to `S[index]`. If `false`, we can place any digit from 0 to 9.
- `has6`: A boolean flag. `true` if we have already placed a '6' digit in the number being formed.
- `has8`: A boolean flag. `true` if we have already placed an '8' digit in the number being formed.
- `isStarted`: A boolean flag. `true` if we have already placed at least one non-zero digit. This is crucial for handling leading zeros, as the problem specifies "without leading zeroes" (e.g., '07' is not a valid number, it's just '7'). For numbers like 1-9, this flag helps distinguish `06` (which should be counted as `6`) from actual multi-digit numbers starting with zero.

**Base Case:**

- If `index === len` (where `len` is the total number of digits in `N`), it means we have successfully formed a number.
    - If `isStarted` is `false`, it implies the number formed was effectively zero (e.g., "0", "00", or "007" if `N` was "007"). Since the range `[L, R]` starts from 1, these numbers are not counted. So, return `0`.
    - Otherwise (`isStarted` is `true`), the number is valid. We check if it's a lucky number: `(has6 && !has8) || (!has6 && has8)`. This condition is `true` if the number contains a '6' but no '8', OR an '8' but no '6'. If it is lucky, return `1`; otherwise, return `0`.

**Recursive Step:**

- Initialize `ans = 0`.
- Determine `upperBound` for the current `digit`: if `tight` is `true`, `upperBound` is `parseInt(S[index])`; otherwise, it's `9`.
- Iterate `digit` from `0` to `upperBound`:
    - Calculate `newTight`: `tight && (digit === upperBound)`.
    - **Handling Leading Zeros:**
        - If `isStarted` is `false` AND `digit` is `0`: We are still placing leading zeros. The `has6` and `has8` flags should not be updated for these zeros, and `isStarted` remains `false`.
        - Else (i.e., `isStarted` is `true` OR `digit` is non-zero): We are either past the leading zeros or just placed the first non-zero digit. Update `has6` and `has8` based on the current `digit`, and set `isStarted` to `true`.
    - Add the result of the recursive call `dfs(index + 1, newTight, newHas6, newHas8, newIsStarted)` to `ans`.

**Memoization:**

- Use a `Map` (or a multi-dimensional array if dimensions are fixed and small) to store results of `dfs` calls. The key for the map can be a string representing the concatenation of the state variables (e.g., `${index}-${tight}-${has6}-${has8}-${isStarted}`).

**Initial Call:**

- The `solve(num: BigInt)` function converts `num` to its string representation `S_global`.
- It then calls `dfs(0, true, false, false, false)`. `tight` is `true` initially because we are constrained by `N`'s digits. `has6`, `has8`, and `isStarted` are all `false` initially.

**BigInt Usage:**

- Since `R` can be up to `10^18`, standard JavaScript `number` type (double-precision floating-point) is insufficient. We must use `BigInt` for `L`, `R`, and any arithmetic operations involving them (like `L - 1n`). `BigInt` literals are suffixed with `n` (e.g., `10n`).

**Final Calculation:**

The total number of lucky numbers in `[L, R]` is `countLuckyNumbersUpToN(R) - countLuckyNumbersUpToN(L - 1n)`.
