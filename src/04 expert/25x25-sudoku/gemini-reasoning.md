The problem asks us to solve a 25x25 Sudoku puzzle. Unlike standard 9x9 Sudoku, this larger version (25x25, using letters A-Y, with 5x5 blocks) is explicitly stated to be too difficult for simple backtracking. This means we need to incorporate robust constraint propagation techniques to significantly prune the search space before and during backtracking.

**Sudoku Rules (25x25):**
1.  Each of the 25 rows must contain each letter 'A' through 'Y' exactly once.
2.  Each of the 25 columns must contain each letter 'A' through 'Y' exactly once.
3.  Each of the 25 (5x5) blocks must contain each letter 'A' through 'Y' exactly once.

**Core Techniques Used:**

1.  **Backtracking (Depth-First Search):** This is the fundamental search algorithm. We pick an unassigned cell, try each valid value for it, and recursively call the solver. If a path leads to a contradiction, we backtrack and try another value.

2.  **Constraint Propagation:** This is critical for making the solver efficient enough for 25x25 grids. It involves deducing values that *must* be true or values that *cannot* be true, thereby reducing the number of candidates for cells and the branching factor of the backtracking search.
    *   **Naked Single:** If a cell has only one possible candidate value remaining, that value must be its solution.
    *   **Hidden Single:** If a specific value can only be placed in one particular cell within a row, column, or 5x5 block, then that cell must contain that value.
    *   **Pointing (Box-Line Reduction):** If all possible positions for a value within a 5x5 block are confined to a single row or column within that block, then that value cannot appear in the rest of that row or column outside that block. This eliminates candidates in other cells.

**Data Structures:**

*   **`grid: number[][]`**: A 25x25 2D array representing the Sudoku board. Empty cells are `-1`. Letters 'A' through 'Y' are mapped to numbers `0` through `24` for easier processing.
*   **`candidates: boolean[][][]`**: A 3D array `candidates[r][c][v]` which is `true` if `v` is a possible value for cell `(r, c)`, and `false` otherwise.
*   **`numCandidates: number[][]`**: A 25x25 2D array where `numCandidates[r][c]` stores the count of possible candidates for cell `(r, c)`. This is used for the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic.
*   **`history: Array<Change>`**: An array used as an "undo log" for backtracking. Each `Change` object records a modification (setting a cell or removing a candidate) along with enough information to revert it. This avoids slow deep copying of the entire grid state.
    *   `Change` types: `cellSet` (a cell was filled) and `candidateRemoved` (a value was removed from a cell's possibilities).
*   **`propagationWorklist: Array<[number, number]>`**: A queue used within the `fullPropagate` function. When a cell's value is set or its candidate count changes (potentially becoming a Naked Single), its coordinates are added to this worklist. `fullPropagate` processes this list to iteratively apply all direct consequences.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Initialization (`solveSudoku`):**
    *   Parse the input grid, converting 'A'-'Y' to 0-24 and '.' to -1.
    *   Initialize `candidates` for all empty cells to contain all values (0-24). `numCandidates` is set to 25.
    *   For pre-filled cells, set their `grid` value, reduce their `candidates` to only their value, and add them to the `propagationWorklist`.
    *   Call `fullPropagate()` to perform initial deductions based on the given clues. If this leads to a contradiction, the puzzle is invalid (though the problem states a unique solution exists).

2.  **`trySetCell(r, c, val)`:**
    *   Attempts to set cell `(r, c)` to `val`.
    *   Records the change in `history` for backtracking.
    *   Updates `grid[r][c]`.
    *   Adds `(r, c)` to `propagationWorklist` so `fullPropagate` can process its implications.
    *   Returns `true` if valid, `false` if `val` was not a possible candidate or caused an immediate contradiction.

3.  **`tryRemoveCandidate(r, c, val)`:**
    *   Attempts to remove `val` as a candidate for `(r, c)`.
    *   Records the change in `history`.
    *   Decrements `numCandidates[r][c]`.
    *   If `numCandidates[r][c]` becomes 0, it's a contradiction (`false` returned).
    *   If `numCandidates[r][c]` becomes 1 (Naked Single), `(r, c)` is added to `propagationWorklist`.
    *   Returns `true` otherwise.

4.  **`fullPropagate()`:**
    *   This function repeatedly applies constraint propagation rules until no more deductions can be made or a contradiction is found.
    *   It uses a `while(changedInRound)` loop to ensure all cascades of deductions are processed.
    *   **Phase 1 (Worklist Processing):** Iterates through `propagationWorklist`.
        *   If a cell `(r, c)` in the worklist is now fixed (`grid[r][c] !== -1`), its value is removed from candidates of all its peers (cells in the same row, column, or block) using `tryRemoveCandidate`.
        *   If a cell `(r, c)` in the worklist became a Naked Single (`numCandidates[r][c] === 1`), its single remaining value is `trySetCell`ed. This might add more cells to the worklist.
    *   **Phase 2 (Hidden Singles):** Iterates through all rows, columns, and blocks. For each value, if it can only be placed in one cell within that unit, that cell is `trySetCell`ed.
    *   **Phase 3 (Pointing/Box-Line Reduction):** Iterates through all 5x5 blocks. For each value, if its possible positions within the block are confined to a single row or column, that value is `tryRemoveCandidate`d from other cells in that row/column outside the block.
    *   If any of these phases make a change, `changedInRound` is set to `true`, and the loop continues (processing the `propagationWorklist` again first).
    *   Returns `true` if successful, `false` on contradiction.

5.  **`recursiveSolve()`:**
    *   **Step 1:** Call `fullPropagate()`. If it returns `false`, immediately return `false` (this branch is invalid).
    *   **Step 2 (Base Case):** Find the unassigned cell `(bestR, bestC)` with the fewest `numCandidates` (MRV heuristic). If no unassigned cells remain (`bestR === -1`), the puzzle is solved, return `true`.
    *   **Step 3 (Backtracking):**
        *   Store the current `history.length` and `propagationWorklist.length` to mark a "checkpoint."
        *   Iterate through each possible `val` for `(bestR, bestC)` (determined from `candidates[bestR][bestC]`).
        *   For each `val`:
            *   Call `trySetCell(bestR, bestC, val)`.
            *   If `trySetCell` is successful (no immediate contradiction):
                *   Recursively call `recursiveSolve()`. If it returns `true`, then a solution is found, so return `true`.
            *   If `trySetCell` or the recursive call fails:
                *   **Backtrack:** Revert all changes made since the `historyCheckpoint` by popping from `history` and undoing each `cellSet` or `candidateRemoved` operation. Also, truncate `propagationWorklist` to its checkpoint.
        *   If no value for `(bestR, bestC)` leads to a solution, return `false`.

**Character-Number Mapping:**
'A' maps to 0, 'B' to 1, ..., 'Y' to 24. This is handled by `charToNum` and `numToChar` helper functions.

The combination of strong constraint propagation and a robust backtracking mechanism with an undo log is essential for solving such a large Sudoku puzzle efficiently within typical time limits.
