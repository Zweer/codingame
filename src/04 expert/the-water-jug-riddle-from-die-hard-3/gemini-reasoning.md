The water jug riddle is a classic problem that can be modeled as a shortest path search on a graph. Each state of the system is defined by the amount of water in each container. The goal is to find the minimum number of moves to reach a state where at least one container holds exactly `W` liters of water. Since we need the *minimum* number of moves, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm.

### Reasoning

1.  **State Representation**: A state can be represented as an array of numbers `currentVolumes: number[]`, where `currentVolumes[i]` is the current volume of water in container `i`. The capacities of the containers are stored in `capacities: number[]`. The initial state is `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (all containers empty).

2.  **Graph and Edges**:
    *   Each unique `currentVolumes` array represents a node in our search graph.
    *   An edge exists between two states if one can be reached from the other by a single valid move. The cost of each edge is 1 (representing one move).

3.  **Possible Moves**: From any given state `currentVolumes`, we can generate new states using three types of moves:
    *   **Fill**: Choose a container `i` and fill it to its capacity `capacities[i]`. `nextVolumes[i] = capacities[i]`. This generates `N` potential new states.
    *   **Empty**: Choose a container `i` and empty it. `nextVolumes[i] = 0`. This also generates `N` potential new states.
    *   **Pour**: Choose a source container `i` and a target container `j` (`i != j`). Pour water from `i` to `j` until `i` is empty or `j` is full. The amount poured is `min(currentVolumes[i], capacities[j] - currentVolumes[j])`. This generates `N * (N-1)` potential new states.

4.  **BFS Algorithm**:
    *   Initialize a queue with the starting state `([0, 0, ..., 0], 0)` (state, moves).
    *   Initialize a `Set<string>` called `visited` to keep track of states already explored. The string representation of a state (e.g., `[1,2,3]` becomes `"1,2,3"`) is used as the key. This prevents cycles and redundant computations, ensuring we find the shortest path.
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue the next state `(currentState, currentMoves)`.
        *   Check if `currentState` satisfies the goal: if any `currentVolumes[i]` equals `W`. If yes, `currentMoves` is the answer.
        *   For each possible move (Fill, Empty, Pour), calculate the `nextState`.
        *   Convert `nextState` to its string representation.
        *   If `nextState` has not been visited:
            *   Add its string representation to `visited`.
            *   Enqueue `(nextState, currentMoves + 1)`.

5.  **Optimizations**:
    *   Using a manual head pointer (`head++`) for the queue instead of `Array.prototype.shift()` improves performance significantly in JavaScript, as `shift()` is an `O(N)` operation for array length `N`. `push()` is amortized `O(1)`.
    *   Using a `Set` for `visited` provides efficient `O(1)` average-time complexity for `add` and `has` operations (though in worst-case with string keys, it can degrade, but typically performs well in competitive programming environments).

6.  **Constraints Analysis**:
    *   `W < 100`, `N < 5`, `Ci < 100`.
    *   The maximum number of states is roughly `100^N`. For `N=4`, this is `10^8` states. While this is a large number of states, the operations per state (array copy, string join, set lookup) are efficient primitives. The number of moves `M` is also relatively small for such problems, indicating that the effective search space visited is usually much smaller than the theoretical maximum. The problem guarantees a solution.
