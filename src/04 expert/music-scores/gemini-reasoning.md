The puzzle asks us to read a black and white image of a music score, decode it from a Run-Length Encoding (RLE) format called DWE, identify the notes, and output them in a specific format (`NoteType` like `AQ` or `DH`).

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Image Decoding (DWE to 2D Grid):**
    *   The input `W H` gives the dimensions.
    *   The DWE string consists of `C L` pairs (Color and Length).
    *   We'll parse this string and fill a 2D boolean array `grid[H][W]`, where `true` represents a black pixel and `false` represents a white pixel.

2.  **Staff Line Detection:**
    *   Music scores have 5 horizontal staff lines. These are typically the longest black horizontal segments in the image.
    *   We'll iterate through each row (`y`) of the image and count the number of black pixels (`blackPixelCounts[y]`).
    *   Rows with a very high black pixel count (e.g., > 80% of `W`) are candidates for staff lines.
    *   These candidate rows are then grouped into contiguous segments. Each segment represents a physical line. We calculate the *center Y-coordinate* and *thickness* for each group.
    *   From these groups, we select the 5 that are most consistently spaced, as these will be the main staff lines.
    *   We store the *center Y-coordinates* of these 5 staff lines in `staffLineY`.
    *   We also calculate the `lineThickness` (average thickness of the staff lines) and `lineToLineSpacing` (average vertical distance between the centers of adjacent staff lines). These values are crucial for later note detection and pitch calculation.

3.  **Note Detection (Connected Components):**
    *   Notes are distinct blobs of black pixels (head + optional tail).
    *   We iterate through the entire `grid` pixel by pixel, typically from left to right, top to bottom.
    *   If we find a black pixel that hasn't been `visited` yet (meaning it's not part of an already processed note or line), we start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find its entire connected component (blob).
    *   During the BFS/DFS, we track the bounding box (`minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, `maxY`) of the blob and store all its pixels. We also mark pixels as `visited` to avoid re-processing.
    *   **Filtering Blobs:** Not every black blob is a note.
        *   Discard very small blobs (noise).
        *   Discard very wide blobs (these are likely remaining parts of staff lines or ledger lines, which are handled later).
        *   To differentiate note *heads* from *tails*: A note head is typically the widest horizontal slice of the blob. We find the `y`-coordinate (`y_center_of_head`) corresponding to this widest slice and its `maxHeadWidth`.
        *   Filter out blobs that are too thin or too disproportionate to be a note head. A note head is roughly as tall as it is wide, roughly the size of `lineToLineSpacing`.

4.  **Determine Note Type (Half/Quarter):**
    *   A quarter note is filled (black inside the oval head), a half note is hollow (white inside).
    *   To determine the type, we examine the pixels within the detected note's head region.
    *   We calculate a "fill ratio": the number of black pixels within the approximate bounding box of the head, divided by the total area of that bounding box.
    *   If the `fillRatio` is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5 or 0.6), it's a Quarter note (`Q`); otherwise, it's a Half note (`H`).

5.  **Determine Note Pitch (A-G):**
    *   The `y_center_of_head` (from step 3) is the primary reference for pitch.
    *   We use the `staffLineY` coordinates and `lineToLineSpacing` to establish the exact vertical positions for all possible notes (C4 to A5).
        *   `staffLineY[0]` corresponds to E4 (lowest staff line).
        *   `staffLineY[4]` corresponds to F5 (highest staff line).
        *   Notes on lines are at `staffLineY[i]`.
        *   Notes in spaces are halfway between `staffLineY[i]` and `staffLineY[i+1]` (or above/below the staff).
        *   Ledger lines (for C4 and A5) are specific distances from the nearest staff line.
    *   For each detected note, we find which theoretical `y`-position (and thus note name) it is closest to.

6.  **Output:**
    *   All detected notes are stored with their `x` coordinate (from the note's left edge), `y_center`, `type`, and `pitch`.
    *   The notes are then sorted by their `x` coordinate to ensure left-to-right reading order.
    *   Finally, the output is formatted as `NoteType` strings separated by spaces.

**Key considerations and empirical tuning:**
*   **Thresholds:** Values like `W_THRESHOLD_FOR_STAFF_LINE_PERCENT`, `HEAD_FILL_RATIO_THRESHOLD`, `NOTE_MIN_PIXELS`, `MIN_NOTE_WIDTH`, etc., are empirical and might need slight adjustments based on the specific test cases.
*   **Robust Staff Line Detection:** The approach of finding line candidates, grouping them, and then selecting the 5 most consistently spaced ones (using variance) is robust against minor image imperfections or extraneous horizontal lines.
*   **Note Head Isolation:** Accurately finding the "center of the head" and its dimensions (`maxHeadWidth`) within a blob is crucial, especially when tails or staff lines intersect. Using the widest horizontal slice is a common heuristic.
