The puzzle "CodinDice" requires finding the minimum number of die rolls to achieve a specific goal state: all dice showing 6 pips on their top face, and all dice forming a single connected group on a 4x4 grid.

**Understanding the Problem and Key Mechanics:**

1.  **State Representation:** A state in our search space must capture the essential information:
    *   The position (x, y) of each die.
    *   The orientation of the 6-face for each die (TOP, BOTTOM, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST).
    *   The unique ID of each die (0 to N-1, based on input order).
    *   The sequence of rolls taken to reach this state.

2.  **Die Properties:** Each die has an `id`, `x`, `y`, `face6` (string representing the orientation of its 6-face), and `isIron` (boolean, if it's an unrollable IRON die). IRON dice always have their 6-face on TOP.

3.  **Rolling Mechanics:**
    *   A roll costs 1 move.
    *   A die can only be rolled into an adjacent (non-diagonal) empty cell within the 4x4 grid boundaries.
    *   Rolling changes the orientation of the 6-face. This is defined by a `rollTransitions` table, which maps the current 6-face orientation and the roll direction to the new 6-face orientation. For example, if the 6-face is `TOP` and the die is rolled `RIGHT`, the 6-face moves to `EAST`.

4.  **Rossi's Movement and Rollability:**
    *   Rossi can walk freely (no cost) between dice that are part of the *same connected group*.
    *   The crucial interpretation: Any non-IRON die, regardless of which connected component it belongs to, can be rolled if it has an adjacent empty cell. The "Rossi's position" flavor text primarily describes *how* Rossi operates, rather than adding a constraint on *which* dice are rollable (i.e., we don't need to track Rossi's specific location within a group in the state). The key rule for rollability is simply "a die has an adjacent empty space".

5.  **Goal Conditions:**
    *   Every die's `face6` must be "TOP".
    *   All `N` dice must form a single connected group (checked using BFS/DFS on the grid).

6.  **Search Algorithm:**
    *   Since we need the *minimum* number of rolls, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the appropriate algorithm. BFS explores states level by level, guaranteeing that the first time a goal state is reached, it's via the shortest path.

7.  **Visited States (Pruning):** To prevent infinite loops and redundant computations, we maintain a `Set` of `visited` states. Each state is serialized into a unique string (e.g., JSON representation of all dice's positions and 6-face orientations) before being added to the `visited` set.

**Detailed Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `Die` interface: `{ id: number, x: number, y: number, face6: string, isIron: boolean }`
    *   `RollAction` interface: `{ dieId: number, direction: string }`
    *   `State` interface: `{ dice: Die[], path: RollAction[] }`

2.  **`rollTransitions` Map:** A constant object defining how `face6` changes based on the roll direction.

3.  **`cloneState(state: State)`:** A helper function to create a deep copy of a state. This is vital for BFS, as modifying states directly in the queue would lead to incorrect behavior.

4.  **`serializeState(state: State)`:** A function to convert a `State` object into a unique string. This involves mapping the `dice` array (which is implicitly sorted by `id`) to an array of objects containing `id`, `x`, `y`, and `face6`, then `JSON.stringify`ing it.

5.  **`isGroupConnected(dice: Die[], N: number)`:**
    *   Construct a temporary 4x4 grid from the current `dice` positions.
    *   Pick any die as a starting point.
    *   Perform a BFS (or DFS) from this starting point to find all reachable dice in the grid.
    *   Count the unique `id`s of the dice visited during the traversal.
    *   If this count equals `N` (the total number of dice), the group is connected.

6.  **BFS Loop:**
    *   Initialize a queue with the `initialState` (read from input) and add its serialized form to the `visited` set.
    *   Loop while the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue the `currentState`.
        *   **Goal Check:** If `currentState` satisfies both goal conditions (`all dice TOP` and `isGroupConnected`), print its `path` and terminate.
        *   **Generate Next States:**
            *   Create a `currentGrid` representing the positions of dice in `currentState` for quick lookup of empty cells.
            *   For each die `D` in `currentState.dice`:
                *   If `D` is `isIron`, skip it.
                *   For each of the four possible roll directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):
                    *   Calculate the `(newX, newY)` destination.
                    *   If `(newX, newY)` is within bounds (0-3) and `currentGrid[newY][newX]` is `null` (empty):
                        *   Create a `newState` by cloning `currentState`.
                        *   Update the `x`, `y`, and `face6` of die `D` in `newState.dice`.
                        *   Add the `RollAction` to `newState.path`.
                        *   Serialize `newState`. If not in `visited`, add it to `visited` and enqueue `newState`.

This BFS approach guarantees finding the shortest solution due to its level-by-level exploration of the state space.
