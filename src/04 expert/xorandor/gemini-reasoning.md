The problem asks us to find the minimum number of toggles (either an input `I_n` from `0` to `1` or vice-versa, or a switch `K_n` from `<` to `>`) required to light up an LED in an electronic circuit. If multiple solutions exist with the same minimum number of steps, we must output the one that appears first when listing the toggled components' names in lexicographical order (e.g., `I1` then `I2`, then `K1`, then `K2`, and so on).

This is a classic shortest-path problem on a state graph, which can be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**1. Circuit Representation and Parsing:**

The circuit is provided as a grid of characters. We need to:
*   Parse the grid to identify all components: LED (`@`), Inputs (`0` or `1`), Switches (`<` or `>`), and various Logic Gates (`~`, `&`, `|`, `+`, `^`, `-`, `=`).
*   Assign unique IDs to each component: `I1, I2, ...` for inputs, `K1, K2, ...` for switches (both ordered top-left to bottom-right), `G1, G2, ...` for gates, and `LED_0` for the LED.
*   Determine the exact coordinates of each component's input and output pins. The problem specifies current flows bottom-to-top. For a component character `X` at `(R, C)`:
    *   **INPUT (`0`, `1`):** Output pin at `(R-1, C)`.
    *   **LED (`@`):** Input pin(s) at `(R+1, C)` (one `|` symbol below it in the example). If multiple wires converge directly below, these are considered distinct inputs.
    *   **NOT Gate (`~`):** Input pin at `(R+1, C)`, Output pin at `(R-1, C)`.
    *   **2-Input Gates (`&`, `|`, `+`, `^`, `-`, `=`):** Input pins at `(R+1, C-1)` and `(R+1, C+1)`. Output pin at `(R-1, C)`.
    *   **Switches (`<`, `>`):** Input pin at `(R+1, C)`. Left output pin at `(R-1, C-1)`, Right output pin at `(R-1, C+1)`.

**2. Wire Tracing (Building the Connection Graph):**

This is the most complex part. We need to establish which component's output feeds into which other component's input.
*   We'll use a `pinCoordToPinInfo` map to quickly look up which component and pin type (input/output/left-output/right-output) a given `(R, C)` coordinate corresponds to.
*   For each component's *output* pin (or a switch's two output pins), perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) on the grid.
*   The search follows wire characters (`|`, `-`, `+`).
*   When the search reaches an *input* pin of another component, a connection is established. This connection is stored in `componentInputLinks`, mapping `targetCompId` to an array of `{ sourceId, sourcePinType }`. For multi-input gates/LEDs, the order of sources in this array matters (e.g., input1, then input2 for a 2-input gate).
*   For switches, their two outputs (left and right) are treated as distinct `sourceId`s (e.g., `K1_LEFT`, `K1_RIGHT`) that feed into other components. The actual value propagated depends on the switch's current state.

**3. Circuit Evaluation:**

A function `isLedLit(config: CurrentConfig)` will determine if the LED is lit for a given configuration of inputs and switches.
*   This function needs to compute the boolean value (on/off, true/false) of each component's output, starting from the base inputs and propagating upwards.
*   Since the circuit is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we can use recursion with memoization (`circuitValues` map) to efficiently compute values and avoid redundant calculations.
*   `evaluateComponent(compId, config)` will compute the output value of a given component.
*   A helper `getPinValue(sourceId, sourcePinType, config)` handles fetching values. For regular components, it calls `evaluateComponent`. For switch outputs (like `K1_LEFT`), it checks the switch's state (`config.switches.get(K1)`) and its input value to determine if current flows through that specific output.
*   The LED is lit if and only if *all* its connected input pins evaluate to `true`.

**4. Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Solution:**

*   **State:** A `BFSState` includes the current `config` (Maps for inputs and switches), `steps` (an array of actions taken to reach this config), and `depth` (number of steps).
*   **Initial State:** All inputs are at their parsed `initialValue` (usually `0`), and all switches are at their `initialDirection` (usually `<`).
*   **Queue and Visited Set:** Standard BFS queue and a `visited` set to prevent cycles and redundant exploration. The `config` is serialized into a string for the `visited` set.
*   **Transitions:** From a `CurrentConfig`, generate new states by toggling exactly one input or one switch.
    *   For toggling inputs, iterate through `allInputIds` (sorted `I1`, `I2`, ...).
    *   For toggling switches, iterate through `allSwitchIds` (sorted `K1`, `K2`, ...).
*   **Goal:** Any state where `isLedLit(config)` returns `true`.
*   **Finding Minimum Steps and Tie-Breaking:**
    *   The first time we find a `minSteps` solution, store it.
    *   If we find other solutions at the *same* `minSteps`, add them to a `solutions` array.
    *   After the BFS completes, sort the `solutions` array. The problem states "top-left bottom-right order" which for actions means lexicographical order of the action names (e.g., `I1` comes before `I2`, `I1` before `K1`). My sorting logic handles this.
    *   Output the steps from the first solution in the sorted `solutions` array.

**Example Walkthrough (from Problem Description):**

Input:
```
9 11
    [@]    
     |     
   [ & ]   
    | |    
  +-+ +-+  
  |     |  
[ | ] [ | ]
 | |   | | 
 0 0   0 0 
```

*   **Inputs:** `I1` (0), `I2` (0), `I3` (0), `I4` (0)
*   **Components:** `LED_0`, `AND_0`, `OR_0`, `OR_1`
*   **Connections:**
    *   `LED_0` input from `AND_0` output.
    *   `AND_0` inputs from `OR_0` output and `OR_1` output.
    *   `OR_0` inputs from `I1` output and `I2` output.
    *   `OR_1` inputs from `I3` output and `I4` output.

**BFS Simulation:**

1.  **Depth 0:** `config = {I1:0, I2:0, I3:0, I4:0}, steps = []`
    *   `isLedLit` -> `OR_0` (0||0)=0, `OR_1` (0||0)=0. `AND_0` (0&&0)=0. LED NOT lit.
    *   Enqueue transitions for `depth = 1`.
2.  **Depth 1:**
    *   `config = {I1:1, I2:0, I3:0, I4:0}, steps = ["I1"]`
        *   `OR_0` (1||0)=1, `OR_1` (0||0)=0. `AND_0` (1&&0)=0. LED NOT lit.
        *   Enqueue transitions for `depth = 2` (e.g., `["I1", "I2"]`, `["I1", "I3"]`, etc.)
    *   ... (other 1-step toggles like "I2", "I3", "I4")
3.  **Depth 2:**
    *   From `config = {I1:1, I2:0, I3:0, I4:0}` (depth 1, path `["I1"]`), toggling `I3`:
        *   `config = {I1:1, I2:0, I3:1, I4:0}, steps = ["I1", "I3"]`
        *   `isLedLit` -> `OR_0` (1||0)=1, `OR_1` (1||0)=1. `AND_0` (1&&1)=1. LED IS LIT!
        *   `minSteps = 2`, `solutions = [["I1", "I3"]]`
    *   From `config = {I1:1, I2:0, I3:0, I4:0}` (depth 1, path `["I1"]`), toggling `I4`:
        *   `config = {I1:1, I2:0, I3:0, I4:1}, steps = ["I1", "I4"]`
        *   `isLedLit` -> `OR_0` (1||0)=1, `OR_1` (0||1)=1. `AND_0` (1&&1)=1. LED IS LIT!
        *   `depth` is 2, which equals `minSteps`. `solutions` becomes `[["I1", "I3"], ["I1", "I4"]]`
    *   ... (similarly for `["I2", "I3"]`, `["I2", "I4"]`, etc.)

After BFS completes, `solutions` will contain all minimum 2-step paths. Sorting `solutions` will put `["I1", "I3"]` first, which is then printed.

The number of inputs and switches being small (`<= 9` each) means a maximum of `2^18` possible states. This is `262,144`, which BFS can handle efficiently.
