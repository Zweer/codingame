The problem asks for the minimum number of drains needed to completely drain all accumulated rainwater from a rectangular map. Water accumulates in "basins" or "depressions" where it cannot flow to a strictly lower adjacent square, or flow freely through adjacent squares of equal height to eventually reach a strictly lower point. Each such independent basin requires exactly one drain at its lowest point to be emptied.

**Understanding Water Flow and Basins:**
1.  **Flow Downhill:** Water flows from a square to an adjacent square if the adjacent square's height is strictly lower.
2.  **Flow Freely (Equal Height):** Water also flows freely between adjacent squares of equal height. This means a flat plateau acts like a single large surface for water flow.
3.  **Accumulation:** Water accumulates in a square if it's the lowest point in a depression, and there's no path (following the flow rules) to a strictly lower point. This depression might include other squares of equal height or higher squares that eventually drain into this lowest point.

**Strategy:**
The core idea is to identify these distinct basins. We can do this by processing the map cells in increasing order of their heights.

1.  **Sort Cells by Height:** Create a list of all cells `(row, col)` along with their `height` and sort this list in ascending order of `height`. This ensures we always process the lowest available cells first.

2.  **Iterate and Identify Basins:**
    *   Maintain a `visited` 2D array, initially all `false`, to keep track of cells that are already part of an identified basin (and thus will be drained).
    *   Iterate through the sorted list of cells. For each cell `(r, c)`:
        *   If `visited[r][c]` is already `true`, it means this cell `(r, c)` belongs to a basin whose lowest point (which must have an equal or lower height) has already been processed. So, it's already accounted for, and we can skip it.
        *   If `visited[r][c]` is `false`, it means `(r, c)` is the lowest point encountered so far for a *new*, undrained basin. We need to place a drain here. Increment our `drainsCount`.
        *   Now that we've found a new basin's lowest point `(r, c)` (with height `h = heights[r][c]`), we need to identify all other cells that belong to this basin and would drain into `(r, c)`. We do this using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from `(r, c)`.
            *   During this BFS, we mark all reachable cells `(nextR, nextC)` as `visited`. The crucial condition for reachability *within this basin* is that `heights[nextR][nextC]` must be greater than or equal to `h` (the height of the basin's lowest point). Water from cells of equal or higher height can flow into `(r, c)`.

**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**
Map:
5 5 5 5 5
5 4 4 4 5
5 3 2 1 5
5 5 5 5 5

1.  **Sorted Cells:** The cell `(2,3)` with height `1` is the lowest. Then `(2,2)` with height `2`, `(2,1)` with height `3`, etc.

2.  **Processing (2,3) (Height 1):**
    *   `visited[2][3]` is `false`.
    *   `drainsCount` becomes `1`.
    *   Start BFS from `(2,3)`. The basin's minimum height `h` is `1`.
    *   Mark `visited[2][3] = true`.
    *   BFS explores neighbors:
        *   `(2,2)` (H=2): `H >= 1`. Not visited. Mark `visited[2][2]=true`. Add to queue.
        *   `(1,3)` (H=4): `H >= 1`. Not visited. Mark `visited[1][3]=true`. Add to queue.
        *   `(2,4)` (H=5): `H >= 1`. Not visited. Mark `visited[2][4]=true`. Add to queue.
        *   `(3,3)` (H=5): `H >= 1`. Not visited. Mark `visited[3][3]=true`. Add to queue.
    *   This BFS will continue. Since all cells in the example map have height `>= 1` and form a single connected component where water can flow (or drain) towards `(2,3)`, all cells will eventually be marked `visited`.

3.  **Remaining Cells:** All subsequent cells in the sorted list will be found to be `visited`, and no new drains will be added.

**Result:** `drainsCount = 1`, which is the correct answer for the example.

**Complexity:**
*   **Time:** `O(N * M * log(N * M))` for sorting all cells. The BFS traversals combined take `O(N * M)` because each cell is visited and processed at most once. Total: `O(N * M * log(N * M))`. Given `N, M <= 100`, `N*M <= 10000`, `log(10000)` is small (around 13-14), so this is efficient enough.
*   **Space:** `O(N * M)` for storing heights, the `allCells` array, and the `visited` array.
