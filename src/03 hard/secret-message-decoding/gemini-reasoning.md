The problem asks us to decode a secret message that has been encoded using linear combinations over Galois Field GF(127). This is essentially a system of linear equations that can be solved using Gaussian elimination.

**Understanding the Encoding Process:**

Let `hs` be the number of message parts and `ms` be the length of each original message part.
The original message is split into `hs` parts, `O_0, O_1, ..., O_{hs-1}`, each containing `ms` characters.
An `hs x hs` identity matrix (`I`) is conceptually prepended to these parts: `[I | O]`.

During encoding, a secret `hs x hs` matrix `H_enc` is used to transform `I` into `H_enc` and `O` into `M_enc`.
So, if the original augmented matrix is `[I | O]`, the encoded matrix sent is `[H_enc | M_enc]`.
This means:
*   The first `hs` columns of each transmitted line form a row of `H_enc`.
*   The last `ms` columns of each transmitted line form a row of `M_enc`.

The relationship is `H_enc * I = H_enc` and `H_enc * O = M_enc`.
To decode, we need to find the inverse of `H_enc`, let's call it `H_enc_inv`.
Then, `H_enc_inv * [H_enc | M_enc]` will yield `[I | O]`.
This is precisely what Gaussian elimination on an augmented matrix achieves: by performing row operations to transform the left block (`H_enc`) into an identity matrix (`I`), the same operations transform the right block (`M_enc`) into the original message parts (`O`).

**Galois Field GF(127):**

All arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are performed modulo 127. Since 127 is a prime number, GF(127) is a finite field.
*   **Modular Addition/Subtraction:** `(a + b) % 127` and `(a - b + 127) % 127` (to ensure positive result for subtraction).
*   **Modular Multiplication:** `(a * b) % 127`.
*   **Modular Division (Multiplicative Inverse):** `a / b` is equivalent to `a * b_inv % 127`, where `b_inv` is the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo 127. For a prime modulus `P`, `b_inv = b^(P-2) % P` by Fermat's Little Theorem. This can be computed efficiently using modular exponentiation (binary exponentiation).

**Decoding Algorithm (Gaussian Elimination):**

1.  **Initialize Augmented Matrix:** Create an `hs` x (`hs + ms`) matrix, `augmentedMatrix`. Each row `i` of this matrix will be populated with the ASCII values of the characters from the `i`-th input string. The first `hs` columns represent `H_enc`, and the last `ms` columns represent `M_enc`.
2.  **Iterate through Pivot Columns:** Loop `j` from `0` to `hs - 1` (representing the current pivot column and pivot row `j`):
    *   **Find Pivot:** Find a row `k` (from `j` to `hs - 1`) such that `augmentedMatrix[k][j]` is non-zero. If multiple options, picking the one with the largest absolute value (though not strictly necessary for GF(P)) can improve numerical stability for floating-point arithmetic; for modular arithmetic, any non-zero pivot works.
    *   **Swap Rows:** If `pivotRow` is not `j`, swap `augmentedMatrix[j]` with `augmentedMatrix[pivotRow]` to bring the pivot element to `augmentedMatrix[j][j]`.
    *   **Make Pivot 1:** Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `augmentedMatrix[j][j]` (the pivot value). Multiply every element in row `j` by this inverse modulo 127. After this step, `augmentedMatrix[j][j]` will be 1.
    *   **Eliminate Other Rows:** For every other row `i` (from `0` to `hs - 1`, where `i != j`):
        *   Determine the `factor = augmentedMatrix[i][j]` (this is the value we want to eliminate).
        *   For every column `col` from `j` to `hs + ms - 1`:
            *   Subtract `factor * augmentedMatrix[j][col]` from `augmentedMatrix[i][col]` modulo 127. This operation will make `augmentedMatrix[i][j]` zero.
3.  **Extract Decoded Message:** After the Gaussian elimination completes, the first `hs` columns of `augmentedMatrix` will form an identity matrix. The remaining `ms` columns (from `hs` to `hs + ms - 1`) will contain the ASCII values of the decoded original message parts.
    To form the final string, concatenate the characters from the first decoded message part (`augmentedMatrix[0][hs]...augmentedMatrix[0][hs+ms-1]`), then the characters from the second part, and so on.

**Example Walkthrough (High-Level):**

For the input:
`hs = 2`
`ms = 1`
`cg$`
`l?(`

Initial `augmentedMatrix` (ASCII values):
`[[99, 103, 36],`
 `[108, 63, 40]]`

After Gaussian elimination (steps involving modular inverse and arithmetic as detailed above):
The matrix will be transformed into `[[1, 0, D1], [0, 1, D2]]`
Where `D1` is the ASCII code for the first character of the first original message part, and `D2` is the ASCII code for the first character of the second original message part.
The final output string is formed by `String.fromCharCode(D1) + String.fromCharCode(D2)`.
