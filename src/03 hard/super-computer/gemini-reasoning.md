The problem asks us to find the maximum number of non-overlapping calculations that can be scheduled on a supercomputer. Each calculation is defined by a start day (`J`) and a duration (`D`).

This is a classic problem known as the **Activity Selection Problem**. The most efficient way to solve this type of problem is using a greedy approach.

**Greedy Strategy:**

The optimal greedy strategy for the activity selection problem is as follows:

1.  **Represent activities:** For each calculation, determine its start day and its end day. If a calculation starts on day `J` and lasts for `D` consecutive days, it occupies days `J`, `J+1`, ..., `J+D-1`. So, its end day is `J + D - 1`.
2.  **Sort activities:** Sort all calculations by their *finish times* (end days) in ascending order. If two calculations have the same finish time, sorting them by their start times (ascending) is a good tie-breaking rule, though often not strictly necessary for correctness, it can make the choice deterministic.
3.  **Select activities:**
    *   Initialize a counter for selected calculations to 0.
    *   Initialize a variable `lastFinishTime` to a value that ensures the first calculation can always be selected (e.g., 0, since all start days `J` are positive).
    *   Iterate through the sorted calculations. For each calculation:
        *   If its start day is greater than or equal to `lastFinishTime + 1` (meaning it starts strictly *after* the previously selected calculation has finished), then select this calculation.
        *   Increment the counter.
        *   Update `lastFinishTime` to the end day of the newly selected calculation.
    *   If the current calculation overlaps with the previously selected one (i.e., `start < lastFinishTime + 1`), then skip it.

**Example Trace (from problem description):**

Calculations:
*   A: J=2, D=5 => Start=2, End=2+5-1=6
*   B: J=9, D=7 => Start=9, End=9+7-1=15
*   C: J=15, D=6 => Start=15, End=15+6-1=20
*   D: J=9, D=3 => Start=9, End=9+3-1=11

Formatted as `(start, end)`:
A: (2, 6)
B: (9, 15)
C: (15, 20)
D: (9, 11)

**1. Sort by End Day:**
1.  A: (2, 6)
2.  D: (9, 11)
3.  B: (9, 15)
4.  C: (15, 20)

**2. Select Activities:**
*   `selectedCalculationsCount = 0`
*   `lastSelectedCalculationFinishTime = 0`

*   **Process A (2, 6):**
    *   `2 >= 0 + 1` (i.e., `2 >= 1`)? Yes.
    *   `selectedCalculationsCount = 1`
    *   `lastSelectedCalculationFinishTime = 6`

*   **Process D (9, 11):**
    *   `9 >= 6 + 1` (i.e., `9 >= 7`)? Yes.
    *   `selectedCalculationsCount = 2`
    *   `lastSelectedCalculationFinishTime = 11`

*   **Process B (9, 15):**
    *   `9 >= 11 + 1` (i.e., `9 >= 12`)? No. Skip B.

*   **Process C (15, 20):**
    *   `15 >= 11 + 1` (i.e., `15 >= 12`)? Yes.
    *   `selectedCalculationsCount = 3`
    *   `lastSelectedCalculationFinishTime = 20`

Final `selectedCalculationsCount = 3`, which matches the example output.

**Complexity:**
*   **Time Complexity:** Reading input takes O(N). Calculating end times is O(N). Sorting takes O(N log N). Iterating through sorted calculations takes O(N). Therefore, the dominant part is sorting, making the total time complexity **O(N log N)**. Given N < 100,000, this is efficient enough.
*   **Space Complexity:** Storing the calculations requires O(N) space.
