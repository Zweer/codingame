The puzzle "There is no Spoon - Episode 2" is a variant of the popular Hashi (Bridges) puzzle. The goal is to connect numbered nodes on a grid using horizontal or vertical links, satisfying specific constraints.

**Problem Analysis:**

1.  **Nodes and Values:** Each node has a number (1-8) indicating how many total links must connect to it.
2.  **Links:**
    *   Connect distinct nodes.
    *   Horizontal or vertical straight lines.
    *   Cannot cross other links or nodes.
    *   At most two links between any pair of nodes.
    *   All nodes must form a single connected group.
3.  **Constraints (Grid Size):** Width and height are at most 30. This suggests that a direct brute-force approach (trying all possible link combinations) would be too slow. A more efficient search strategy like backtracking with strong pruning and constraint propagation is required.

**Algorithm Design (Backtracking with Constraint Propagation):**

This problem is a classic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) best solved with a backtracking search (Depth-First Search - DFS) combined with constraint propagation.

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   **`Node` Class:** Represents a node on the grid. It stores its `x`, `y` coordinates, and its `value` (the required number of links).
    *   **`CurrentBoardState` Class:** This class holds the entire state of the puzzle at a given point in the search. It's crucial for backtracking:
        *   `nodesGrid`: A 2D array representing the grid, containing `Node` objects or `null` for empty cells.
        *   `allNodes`: A flat list of all `Node` objects.
        *   `links`: A list of `Link` objects already placed in this state. Each `Link` object stores the two connected `Point`s (`{x,y}`) and the `amount` of links (1 or 2).
        *   `adj`: An adjacency map `Map<Node, Map<Node, number>>` to store the *current* number of links between any two connected nodes. This is used for connectivity checks.
        *   `availableLinks`: A map `Map<Node, Map<Node, number>>` storing how many additional links (1 or 2) can *still* be placed between any two potential neighboring nodes. This is dynamic and decreases as links are added.
        *   `nodeCurrentLinkCount`: A map `Map<Node, number>` tracking the *current total* links connected to each node.
        *   `isCellBlockedForCrossing`: A 2D boolean array that marks cells that are now occupied by a placed link. This is used to efficiently check the "no crossing links" rule.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Read `width`, `height`, and the grid `lines`.
    *   Create `Node` objects for each numbered cell and populate `nodesGrid` and `allNodes`.
    *   For each node, identify its *direct* horizontal and vertical neighbors (i.e., no other nodes between them). Initialize `availableLinks` between these pairs to 2.

3.  **`solve(board: CurrentBoardState)` Function (The Backtracking Core):**

    *   **Global `solutionFound` flag:** To stop the search immediately once the first solution is found and printed.

    *   **Constraint Propagation Loop:** This is the most vital part for performance. It iteratively applies "forced moves" and prunes invalid branches before branching.
        *   **Pruning (Early Exit Conditions):**
            *   If `nodeCurrentLinkCount` for any node exceeds its `value`.
            *   If a node *needs* `X` more links, but the `maxPossibleFromNode` (sum of `availableLinks` to all neighbors) is less than `X`. This means it's impossible to satisfy the node.
        *   **Forced Moves:**
            *   **Node Satisfied:** If a node's `nodeCurrentLinkCount` equals its `value`, then set `availableLinks` to 0 for all its neighbors (it cannot accept more links).
            *   **Exact Match (Total Available):** If a node needs `X` links, and the `maxPossibleFromNode` is exactly `X`, then all available links to its neighbors *must* be taken. For example, if a node needs 3 links and has one neighbor with 1 available and another with 2 available, it must take both.
            *   **Single Neighbor Option:** If a node needs `X` links and only has one neighbor `N` with `Y >= X` available links, then it *must* place `X` links to `N`.

    *   **Base Cases (After Propagation):**
        *   **Success:** If `board.isAllNodesSatisfied()` (all nodes have their required links) AND `board.isConnected()` (all nodes form a single group), then a valid solution is found. Print the `board.links` and set `solutionFound = true`. Return `true`.
        *   **Failure:** If `board.isAllNodesSatisfied()` is true, but `board.isConnected()` is false, this path is invalid (isolated groups). Return `false`.

    *   **Heuristic for Next Move:**
        *   If the board is not yet solved, pick the "most constrained" unsatisfied node. This is typically a node that needs more links but has the fewest `currentOptions` (sum of `availableLinks` to its neighbors). This helps reduce the branching factor early.

    *   **Recursive Step (Branching):**
        *   For the `bestNode` chosen by the heuristic, iterate through its neighbors.
        *   **Try 2 links:** If 2 links are `availableLinks` to a neighbor, create a `newState` (deep copy of the current board). Add 2 links. Recurse `solve(newState)`. If it returns `true`, propagate `true` upwards.
        *   **Try 1 link:** If 1 or 2 links are `availableLinks` to a neighbor (and the 2-link option, if tried, didn't lead to a solution), create another `newState`. Add 1 link. Recurse `solve(newState)`. If it returns `true`, propagate `true` upwards.
        *   If none of the options for the `bestNode` lead to a solution, return `false` (backtrack).

4.  **`CurrentBoardState.clone()` Method:**
    *   This is crucial for backtracking. It creates a new `CurrentBoardState` object that is a deep copy of the current one, allowing modifications in the new state without affecting the parent state.
    *   It correctly maps old `Node` objects to new `Node` objects to ensure `adj`, `availableLinks`, and `nodeCurrentLinkCount` maps reference the correct instances in the cloned state.

5.  **`CurrentBoardState.addLink()` Method:**
    *   Handles placing a link, updating `nodeCurrentLinkCount`, `adj`, `availableLinks`.
    *   Crucially, it calls `isCrossingBlocked()` and `markBlockedCells()` to enforce the "no crossing links" rule. `isCellBlockedForCrossing` efficiently tracks occupied segments.

6.  **`CurrentBoardState.isConnected()` Method:**
    *   Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from an arbitrary node to check if all nodes are reachable.

This approach balances aggressive pruning with systematic exploration, which is necessary for the given grid size constraints.
