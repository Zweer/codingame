The problem asks us to implement a Boggle word searcher. Given a 4x4 grid of letters and a list of candidate words, we need to determine if each word can be formed by connecting adjacent letters (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), using each grid cell at most once per word.

This is a classic graph traversal problem, best solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) or backtracking.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Read Input**:
    *   Store the 4x4 letter grid in a 2D array (e.g., `string[][]`).
    *   Read the number of words `N`.
    *   For each of the `N` words, read the word.

2.  **For each Candidate Word**:
    *   Initialize a `foundWord` flag to `false`.
    *   **Iterate through every cell (row, col) in the 4x4 grid**:
        *   If the letter at `grid[row][col]` matches the first letter of the `wordToCheck`:
            *   Initialize a new `visited` 2D boolean array of size 4x4. This array will keep track of cells used for the *current* word search attempt. It must be reset for each new word.
            *   Start a DFS from this cell: `dfs(row, col, 0, wordToCheck, visited)`.
            *   If the `dfs` function returns `true` (meaning the word was found starting from this cell):
                *   Set `foundWord = true` and `break` out of the inner loops (no need to search further for this word).
    *   Print `"true"` if `foundWord` is `true`, otherwise print `"false"`.

3.  **DFS Function (`dfs(row, col, wordIndex, targetWord, visited)`):**
    *   **Purpose**: This recursive function attempts to find `targetWord` starting from `grid[row][col]` at `wordIndex` (meaning `grid[row][col]` should match `targetWord[wordIndex]`).
    *   **Mark Visited**: Mark `visited[row][col]` as `true`. We are at this cell because it matched the character at `targetWord[wordIndex]`.
    *   **Base Case**: If `wordIndex` is equal to `targetWord.length - 1`, it means we have successfully matched the last character of the word. Return `true`.
    *   **Explore Neighbors**: Iterate through all 8 possible adjacent directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). For each neighbor `(newR, newC)`:
        *   **Check Bounds**: Ensure `(newR, newC)` is within the 4x4 grid boundaries (`0 <= newR < 4` and `0 <= newC < 4`).
        *   **Check Visited**: Ensure `visited[newR][newC]` is `false` (the cell has not been used in the current path).
        *   **Check Character Match**: Ensure `grid[newR][newC]` matches `targetWord[wordIndex + 1]` (the *next* character we are looking for in the word). This is a crucial optimization to prune search paths early.
        *   **Recursive Call**: If all conditions are met, recursively call `dfs(newR, newC, wordIndex + 1, targetWord, visited)`.
        *   **Propagate Result**: If the recursive call returns `true`, immediately return `true` yourself (the word has been found through this path).
    *   **Backtrack**: If none of the adjacent cells lead to finding the rest of the word, unmark `visited[row][col]` as `false`. This allows other potential paths (originating from a different starting cell for the same word) to use this cell.
    *   **Return False**: If all neighbors have been explored and none led to a solution, return `false`.

Word: `ARDENT`

1.  Outer loops find 'A' at `(1,3)`.
2.  Call `dfs(1, 3, 0, "ARDENT", visited)`:
    *   `visited[1][3] = true`. `wordIndex = 0`, not last char.
    *   Look for 'R' (targetWord[1]) in neighbors of (1,3):
        *   Find 'R' at `(0,3)`. It's in bounds, not visited, and matches 'R'.
        *   Call `dfs(0, 3, 1, "ARDENT", visited)`:
            *   `visited[0][3] = true`. `wordIndex = 1`, not last char.
            *   Look for 'D' (targetWord[2]) in neighbors of (0,3):
                *   Find 'D' at `(1,2)`. It's in bounds, not visited, and matches 'D'.
                *   Call `dfs(1, 2, 2, "ARDENT", visited)`:
                    *   `visited[1][2] = true`. `wordIndex = 2`, not last char.
                    *   Look for 'E' (targetWord[3]) in neighbors of (1,2):
                        *   Find 'E' at `(2,2)`. It's in bounds, not visited, and matches 'E'.
                        *   Call `dfs(2, 2, 3, "ARDENT", visited)`:
                            *   `visited[2][2] = true`. `wordIndex = 3`, not last char.
                            *   Look for 'N' (targetWord[4]) in neighbors of (2,2):
                                *   Find 'N' at `(2,1)`. It's in bounds, not visited, and matches 'N'.
                                *   Call `dfs(2, 1, 4, "ARDENT", visited)`:
                                    *   `visited[2][1] = true`. `wordIndex = 4`, not last char.
                                    *   Look for 'T' (targetWord[5]) in neighbors of (2,1):
                                        *   Find 'T' at `(3,2)`. It's in bounds, not visited, and matches 'T'.
                                        *   Call `dfs(3, 2, 5, "ARDENT", visited)`:
                                            *   `visited[3][2] = true`. `wordIndex = 5`.
                                            *   **Base Case:** `wordIndex` (5) is `targetWord.length - 1` (6-1=5). Return `true`.
                                    *   `dfs(3, 2, 5, ...)` returned `true`. Return `true`.
                            *   `dfs(2, 1, 4, ...)` returned `true`. Return `true`.
                        *   `dfs(2, 2, 3, ...)` returned `true`. Return `true`.
                *   `dfs(1, 2, 2, ...)` returned `true`. Return `true`.
        *   `dfs(0, 3, 1, ...)` returned `true`. Return `true`.
    *   `dfs(1, 3, 0, ...)` returned `true`. Set `foundWord = true`. Break loops.
3.  Print `true`.
