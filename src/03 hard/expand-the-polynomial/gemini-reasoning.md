The problem requires expanding a given polynomial expression, which may be partially or fully factorized, and representing it in a standard, simplified form. This involves handling addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation of polynomials.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Polynomial Representation**:
    A polynomial can be effectively represented as a map (or hash table) where keys are exponents and values are their corresponding coefficients. For example, `x^2 + x - 2` would be `{2: 1, 1: 1, 0: -2}`. This representation simplifies operations like addition and multiplication, as terms with the same exponent can be easily combined.

    A `Polynomial` class is defined with a `Map<number, number>` for `coefficients`. It includes:
    *   Constructor: Initializes the polynomial, optionally with existing coefficients.
    *   Static factory methods: `fromConstant(value: number)` for numeric constants (e.g., `5`) and `fromX(exponent: number)` for terms like `x` or `x^2`.
    *   `add(other: Polynomial)`: Adds two polynomials by summing coefficients of like powers.
    *   `multiply(other: Polynomial)`: Multiplies two polynomials by distributing each term of one polynomial across all terms of the other, then summing coefficients of like powers.
    *   `power(n: number)`: Raises the polynomial to a non-negative integer power `n`. This is implemented using binary exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring) for efficiency.
    *   `normalize()`: A helper method to remove terms with zero coefficients (e.g., `0x^2`), ensuring a clean representation.
    *   `toString()`: Converts the polynomial to its standard string format:
        *   Terms are ordered by decreasing exponent.
        *   `x^1` is written as `x`.
        *   `1x^N` is written as `x^N`.
        *   `0x^N` terms are omitted.
        *   `x^0` terms (constants) are omitted if their coefficient is zero, or written as just the number (e.g., `+5` or `-2`).
        *   Handles signs and spaces correctly (e.g., `x^2+x-2`).

2.  **Parsing the Input**:
    The input string is an arithmetic expression involving polynomials. A recursive descent parser is a suitable approach for this. The parser defines functions for different levels of operator precedence:
    *   `parseExpression()`: Handles addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`), which have the lowest precedence. It parses terms and combines them.
    *   `parseTerm()`: Handles multiplication (`*`), which has medium precedence. It parses factors and multiplies them.
    *   `parseFactor()`: Handles the highest precedence operations, including:
        *   Parenthesized expressions `(Polynomial Expression)`: Recursively calls `parseExpression` to evaluate the content inside.
        *   Exponentiation `^`: After parsing a base factor, it checks for `^` followed by an exponent number, then calls the `power` method.
        *   Atomic terms: These are individual components like `x`, `x^N`, constants (e.g., `5`), or terms with coefficients (e.g., `3x`, `-2x^4`). It correctly handles leading signs (`-x`), numeric coefficients, and exponents.

    **Parser State Management**: A global `pos` variable tracks the current parsing position in the input string. Helper functions like `consume()`, `peek()`, and `isEOF()` manage this state.

    **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included for mismatched parentheses, unexpected tokens, and invalid exponents.

3.  **Overall Flow (`expandPolynomial` function)**:
    *   Removes all whitespace from the input string.
    *   Initializes the `pos` to 0.
    *   Calls `parseExpression()` to start the parsing process.
    *   After parsing, it checks if the entire input string has been consumed to catch unparsed trailing characters.
    *   Finally, it calls the `toString()` method on the resulting `Polynomial` object to get the standard string representation.

This structured approach allows for robust parsing of various polynomial expressions and their accurate expansion and simplification.
