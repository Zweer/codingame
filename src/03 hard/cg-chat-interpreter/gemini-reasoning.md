The puzzle requires implementing a chat interpreter that understands specific commands related to numeric constants and stack operations. Each nickname (nick) in the chat has an associated stack and a "context" (another nick they are currently addressing).

Here's a breakdown of the solution logic:

1.  **Global State Management:**
    *   `goodNouns` and `badNouns`: `Set<string>` to store lists of words representing positive (1) and negative (-1) base values.
    *   `nickStacks`: `Map<string, number[]>` to store a stack (array of numbers) for each registered nick.
    *   `nickContexts`: `Map<string, string>` to store the current conversation context for each speaker nick (speaker -> target nick).
    *   `outputBuffer`: `number[]` to collect values printed by "tell" commands.

2.  **Text Preprocessing:**
    *   All input lines are converted to lowercase (`toLowerCase()`).
    *   Punctuation is removed (`replace(/[.,!?;:'"()[\]{}]/g, '')`).
    *   Multiple spaces are normalized to single spaces, and leading/trailing spaces are trimmed (`replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim()`). This `cleanText` helper is crucial for consistent parsing.

3.  **Line-by-Line Processing:**
    *   **Speaker Extraction:** Each line starts with `<nick>`. The `currentSpeaker` is extracted and updated. If a line doesn't have a speaker tag, it's ignored (e.g., comments from `__observer` not actively participating).
    *   **Immediate Context Change:** If the *first* token after the speaker tag is `*nick*`, the `currentSpeaker`'s context is immediately set to `nick` for the current line and subsequent lines. The `*nick*` token is then removed from the line, allowing another command to be processed on the same line.
    *   **Command Detection and Execution:** The cleaned line (after speaker and potential immediate context change) is then checked for specific command keywords in order:
        *   **Assignment (`ur`, `your`, `youre`):** The rest of the line is treated as a `constant` phrase. Its value is evaluated and pushed onto the `activeContext`'s stack.
        *   **Stack Operations (`listen`, `forget`, `flip`):** These commands modify the `activeContext`'s stack.
            *   `listen`: Duplicates the top value (or pushes 0 if stack is empty).
            *   `forget`: Pops the top value (or does nothing if stack is empty).
            *   `flip`: Swaps the top two values (or does nothing if fewer than two values).
        *   **Output (`tell`, `telling`):** Pops the top value from the `activeContext`'s stack (or 0 if empty) and adds it to the `outputBuffer`.
    *   **Context Setting Statement:** If no explicit command is found and no immediate context change occurred, the line is checked for the general context setting pattern (`*{nick}*` anywhere in the flavor text). If found, the `currentSpeaker`'s context is set to the mentioned `nick`.
    *   **Skipping Lines:** If a speaker has no context set (and the line does not initiate an immediate context change or explicitly set a context via flavor text), any commands or text from that speaker are ignored.

4.  **Constant Evaluation (`evaluateConstant` function):**
    This is the most complex part, handling various forms of constants:
    *   **Parsing Strategy:** The `evaluateConstant` function works by first trying to match the outermost arithmetic expressions. It uses `lastIndexOf` for keywords like "multiplied", "though", "too" to correctly identify the boundaries of nested constant phrases. This allows recursive evaluation of the operands.
        *   `{constant} by {constant} multiplied`: Multiplies the two constants.
        *   `{constant} but not {constant} though`: Subtracts the second constant from the first.
        *   `{constant} and {constant} too`: Adds the two constants.
        *   `{constant} squared`: Squares the constant.
    *   **Special Constants:** If no arithmetic pattern matches, it checks for single-token special constants:
        *   `"me"`: Returns the top value of the speaker's stack.
        *   `"you"`, `"u"`: Returns the top value of the context's stack.
        *   `*{nick}*`: Returns the top value of the specified `nick`'s stack. (All without popping). If a stack is empty, 0 is returned.
    *   **Noun Phrases:** If still no match, it attempts to parse a simple noun phrase: `{a/an} {adjective(s)} {noun}`.
        *   It identifies an optional article (`a`/`an`).
        *   It finds the noun (from `goodNouns` or `badNouns`).
        *   All words *between* the article (or start of phrase if no article) and the noun are counted as adjectives.
        *   The value is calculated as `(noun_base_value) * (2 ^ num_adjectives)`.

5.  **Stack Operations Helpers:**
    *   `getStack(nick)`: Ensures a stack exists for a given nick, creating an empty array if not.
    *   `peekStack(stack)`: Returns the top element without removing it, or `0` if the stack is empty.

6.  **Output:** Finally, all collected output values in `outputBuffer` are joined by hyphens (`-`) and printed.

This structured approach, with careful text cleaning and recursive constant evaluation, handles the various rules described in the puzzle.
