The problem asks us to decompose a given positive integer or fraction `N` into a product of powers of factorials of prime numbers. The format for each term is `p#e` representing `(p!)^e`, where `p` is a prime number. The output should list non-zero terms in descending order of the prime `p`.

Let `N = numerator / denominator`. We want to find integer exponents `e_p` for prime numbers `p` such that:
`N = Product (p!)^(e_p)`

To solve this, we can use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For any prime `q`, the exponent of `q` in the prime factorization of `N` must be equal to the exponent of `q` in the prime factorization of `Product (p!)^(e_p)`.

Let `v_q(X)` denote the exponent of prime `q` in the prime factorization of `X`.
Then, `v_q(N) = v_q(numerator) - v_q(denominator)`.
Also, `v_q(Product (p!)^(e_p)) = Sum_p (e_p * v_q(p!))`.

The exponent of a prime `q` in the prime factorization of `n!` is given by Legendre's Formula:
`E_q(n!) = floor(n/q) + floor(n/q^2) + floor(n/q^3) + ...`

So, for each prime `q` (which must be less than 2000 as per constraints, since `p` values are less than 2000):
`v_q(N) = Sum_{p prime, p <= MAX_PRIME_VALUE} (e_p * E_q(p!))`

This forms a system of linear equations. Notice that `E_q(p!)` is zero if `q > p`. This means that for a given `q`, only primes `p >= q` will contribute to the sum.
The equation can be rewritten as:
`v_q(N) = e_q * E_q(q!) + Sum_{p prime, p > q, p <= MAX_PRIME_VALUE} (e_p * E_q(p!))`
Since `E_q(q!)` is always 1 (as `floor(q/q) = 1` and `floor(q/q^k) = 0` for `k > 1`), the equation simplifies to:
`v_q(N) = e_q + Sum_{p prime, p > q, p <= MAX_PRIME_VALUE} (e_p * E_q(p!))`

This allows us to solve for `e_q` by iterating primes `q` in *descending* order, using the `e_p` values for `p > q` that have already been computed. This is a form of back-substitution.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Precompute Primes:** Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to `MAX_PRIME_VALUE = 1999` (as specified by the "Every prime involved is less than 2000" constraint). Store them in two lists: one ascending (`primesAscending`) and one descending (`primesDescending`).

2.  **Parse Input `N`:** Read the input string `N`. If it contains a `/`, parse it as `numerator/denominator`. Otherwise, it's an integer, so `denominator = 1`.

3.  **Prime Factorize `numerator` and `denominator`:** For each `num` and `den`, find the counts of each prime factor `q` (i.e., `v_q(num)` and `v_q(den)`). Then, calculate `v_q(N) = v_q(num) - v_q(den)` for all primes `q <= MAX_PRIME_VALUE`. Store these in a map (`v_q_N_map`).

4.  **Precompute Legendre's Exponents:** For all primes `p, q <= MAX_PRIME_VALUE` where `q <= p`, calculate `E_q(p!)` using Legendre's Formula. Store these values in a 2D map (`leg_exponents[p][q]`).

5.  **Solve for `e_p` (Exponents of Factorials):**
    *   Initialize an empty map `decompositionMap` to store the final `p#e_p` exponents.
    *   Iterate through `primesDescending` (from `MAX_PRIME_VALUE` down to 2). Let the current prime be `current_prime_p`.
    *   Calculate `sum_of_higher_terms = Sum_{higher_prime > current_prime_p} (e_higher_prime * E_current_prime_p(higher_prime!))`. The `e_higher_prime` values are already known from previous iterations (since we are iterating in descending order).
    *   Calculate `e_current_prime = v_current_prime_p(N) - sum_of_higher_terms`.
    *   If `e_current_prime` is non-zero, store it in `decompositionMap` (e.g., `decompositionMap.set(current_prime_p, e_current_prime)`).

6.  **Format Output:**
    *   Create a list of strings.
    *   Iterate through `primesDescending`. For each prime `p`, if `decompositionMap` contains a non-zero exponent `e_p` for `p`, append `${p}#${e_p}` to the list.
    *   Join the strings in the list with spaces and print the result.

**Example `N=22` Trace:**
1.  `primesDescending = [1999, ..., 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]`
2.  `numerator = 22`, `denominator = 1`
3.  `v_q_N_map = {2: 1, 11: 1}` (since `22 = 2^1 * 11^1`)
4.  `leg_exponents` are precomputed (e.g., `E_11(11!)=1`, `E_7(11!)=1`, `E_5(11!)=2`, `E_3(11!)=4`, `E_2(11!)=8`, etc.)
5.  **Solve for `e_p`:**
    *   `p=1999` down to `p=13`: `e_p = 0` (as `v_p(N)=0` and `sum_of_higher_terms=0`).
    *   `p=11`: `v_11(N) = 1`. `sum_of_higher_terms = 0`. `e_11 = 1 - 0 = 1`. `decompositionMap = {11: 1}`.
    *   `p=7`: `v_7(N) = 0`. `sum_of_higher_terms = e_11 * E_7(11!) = 1 * 1 = 1`. `e_7 = 0 - 1 = -1`. `decompositionMap = {11: 1, 7: -1}`.
    *   `p=5`: `v_5(N) = 0`. `sum_of_higher_terms = e_11 * E_5(11!) + e_7 * E_5(7!) = 1 * 2 + (-1) * 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. `e_5 = 0 - 1 = -1`. `decompositionMap = {11: 1, 7: -1, 5: -1}`.
    *   `p=3`: `v_3(N) = 0`. `sum_of_higher_terms = e_11 * E_3(11!) + e_7 * E_3(7!) + e_5 * E_3(5!) = 1 * 4 + (-1) * 2 + (-1) * 1 = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1`. `e_3 = 0 - 1 = -1`. `decompositionMap = {11: 1, 7: -1, 5: -1, 3: -1}`.
    *   `p=2`: `v_2(N) = 1`. `sum_of_higher_terms = e_11 * E_2(11!) + e_7 * E_2(7!) + e_5 * E_2(5!) + e_3 * E_2(3!) = 1 * 8 + (-1) * 4 + (-1) * 3 + (-1) * 1 = 8 - 4 - 3 - 1 = 0`. `e_2 = 1 - 0 = 1`. `decompositionMap = {11: 1, 7: -1, 5: -1, 3: -1, 2: 1}`.
6.  **Output:** `11#1 7#-1 5#-1 3#-1 2#1`

This method correctly reproduces the example outputs and handles the constraints.
