The problem asks us to rotate a matrix counterclockwise by `X` positions. The rotation happens in "layers" or "rings" from the outermost to the innermost. Elements in the very center (if the matrix dimensions are odd) do not move. The value of `X` can be very large, meaning a direct simulation of `X` individual shifts is not feasible.

**Understanding the Rotation:**

The example `7x5` matrix with `X=1` shows elements moving along the perimeter. A counterclockwise shift means:
*   Elements on the left edge move down.
*   Elements on the bottom edge move right.
*   Elements on the right edge move up.
*   Elements on the top edge move left.

This is equivalent to each element moving to the "next" position in the counterclockwise path around its ring. If we list the elements of a ring in counterclockwise order (e.g., top-left, then down, then right, then up, then left towards top-left), then an `X` position counterclockwise shift is a `X`-step *left* circular shift of this linear list of elements.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Iterate through Layers:** The matrix can be decomposed into concentric rectangular layers. We process these layers one by one, starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards.
    *   A layer is defined by its top-left `(row, col)` and bottom-right `(maxRow, maxCol)` coordinates.
    *   Initially, `(row, col) = (0, 0)` and `(maxRow, maxCol) = (H-1, W-1)`.
    *   In each iteration, after processing a layer, we shrink the boundaries: `row++`, `col++`, `maxRow--`, `maxCol--`. The loop continues as long as `row <= maxRow` and `col <= maxCol`.

2.  **Extract Layer Elements and Coordinates:** For each layer:
    *   Create a temporary list `layerElements` to store the values of elements in the current layer.
    *   Create a corresponding temporary list `layerCoordinates` to store the `[row, col]` pairs for each element. The order of elements in these lists is crucial: they must follow the counterclockwise path.
    *   The path sequence for extraction (to simulate counterclockwise movement via left shift) is:
        1.  Top row: `(currentLayerRow, c)` from `c = currentLayerCol` to `currentLayerMaxCol`.
        2.  Right column: `(r, currentLayerMaxCol)` from `r = currentLayerRow + 1` to `currentLayerMaxRow` (skipping the top-right corner, which was already added).
        3.  Bottom row: `(currentLayerMaxRow, c)` from `c = currentLayerMaxCol - 1` down to `currentLayerCol` (skipping the bottom-right corner). This step only applies if there's a distinct bottom row (i.e., `currentLayerRow < currentLayerMaxRow`).
        4.  Left column: `(r, currentLayerCol)` from `r = currentLayerMaxRow - 1` down to `currentLayerRow + 1` (skipping bottom-left and top-left corners). This step only applies if there's a distinct left column (i.e., `currentLayerCol < currentLayerMaxCol`).

3.  **Calculate Effective Shift:**
    *   Let `ringLength` be the number of elements in `layerElements`.
    *   The effective number of shifts is `effectiveShift = X % ringLength`. Using modulo handles large `X` values efficiently. If `ringLength` is 0 (e.g., for certain degenerate inner layers or a single central element that doesn't form a perimeter), we break the loop.

4.  **Perform Circular Shift:**
    *   Perform a circular *left* shift on `layerElements` by `effectiveShift` positions. This can be done efficiently in JavaScript/TypeScript using `slice()` and `concat()`: `shiftedElements = layerElements.slice(effectiveShift).concat(layerElements.slice(0, effectiveShift))`.

5.  **Place Shifted Elements Back:**
    *   Initialize a `resultMatrix` as a deep copy of the original input `matrix`. This is important because elements in the very center of the matrix (if `W` and `H` are both odd) do not move and should retain their original values.
    *   Iterate through `shiftedElements` and `layerCoordinates` simultaneously. For each `i`, place `shiftedElements[i]` into `resultMatrix` at `layerCoordinates[i][0], layerCoordinates[i][1]`.

6.  **Output:** After processing all layers, print the `resultMatrix`.

**Example Trace (3x3, X=1):**

Original Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

1.  **Layer 1 (Outer):** `(row, col) = (0,0)`, `(maxRow, maxCol) = (2,2)`
    *   `layerElements` and `layerCoordinates` collected (Top -> Right -> Bottom (rev) -> Left (rev)):
        *   (0,0)=1, (0,1)=2, (0,2)=3
        *   (1,2)=6, (2,2)=9
        *   (2,1)=8, (2,0)=7
        *   (1,0)=4
    *   `layerElements = [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4]`
    *   `ringLength = 8`
    *   `effectiveShift = 1 % 8 = 1`
    *   `shiftedElements = [2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 1]` (circular left shift by 1)
    *   Place `shiftedElements` back into `resultMatrix` at `layerCoordinates`.
    *   `resultMatrix` after this layer:
        2 3 6
        1 5 9
        4 7 8 (Note: '5' at (1,1) remains untouched from initial deep copy)

2.  **Next Layer Boundaries:** `(row, col) = (1,1)`, `(maxRow, maxCol) = (1,1)`
    *   Loop condition `currentLayerRow <= currentLayerMaxRow` and `currentLayerCol <= currentLayerMaxCol` is `1 <= 1` (true).
    *   `layerElements`: Top `(1,1)` adds `matrix[1][1]` (which is `5`).
    *   Right, Bottom, Left loops for this 1x1 layer do not add elements due to boundary checks (`r >= currentLayerRow + 1` or `c >= currentLayerCol` etc. adjusted for 1-cell dimensions).
    *   `ringLength = 1`
    *   `effectiveShift = 1 % 1 = 0`.
    *   `shiftedElements = [5]` (no shift occurs)
    *   The value `5` is placed back at `(1,1)` in `resultMatrix`. This effectively means no change for the center element, which is correct.

The loop terminates as `row` becomes `2`, `maxRow` becomes `0`, etc.

The final `resultMatrix` is printed.
