The problem asks us to decrypt a ciphertext (`cipherText2`) using a Bifid cipher. We are not given the key (the Polybius square), but we are provided with a known plaintext-ciphertext pair (`plainText1` and `cipherText1`) that were encrypted with the same hidden key.

The core challenge is to deduce the Bifid key (the 5x5 Polybius square) from the known plaintext-ciphertext pair. Once the key is known, decrypting the second ciphertext is a straightforward application of the Bifid decryption algorithm.

### Bifid Cipher Mechanism (Recap from Problem Description)

Let `L` be the length of the plaintext after cleaning (removing spaces, converting 'J' to 'I', uppercasing).

**Encryption:**
1.  **Plaintext to Coordinates:** Each character `P_k` in the cleaned plaintext `P` is mapped to its `(row_k, col_k)` coordinates in the Polybius square.
2.  **Combine Coordinates:** All row coordinates are concatenated to form `R_sequence = row_0 row_1 ... row_{L-1}`. All column coordinates are concatenated to form `C_sequence = col_0 col_1 ... col_{L-1}`. These two sequences are then concatenated: `S_digits = R_sequence + C_sequence`. This `S_digits` sequence has a total length of `2L`.
3.  **Group and Lookup:** `S_digits` is grouped into `L` pairs of digits: `(S_digits[0], S_digits[1]), (S_digits[2], S_digits[3]), ..., (S_digits[2L-2], S_digits[2L-1])`. Each pair `(r', c')` is used to look up a character `C_k = Polybius[r'][c']` in the Polybius square, forming the ciphertext `C`.

**Decryption (Reverse of Encryption):**
1.  **Ciphertext to Coordinates:** Each character `C_k` in the cleaned ciphertext `C` is mapped to its `(row'_k, col'_k)` coordinates in the Polybius square.
2.  **Separate Coordinates:** The row coordinates `row'_0 row'_1 ... row'_{L-1}` are extracted into one sequence. The column coordinates `col'_0 col'_1 ... col'_{L-1}` are extracted into another sequence. Let's call these `Dec_R_sequence` and `Dec_C_sequence`.
3.  **Group and Lookup:** The original plaintext coordinates `(row_k, col_k)` are recovered by taking `(Dec_R_sequence[k], Dec_C_sequence[k])`. Each such pair is then used to look up a character `P_k = Polybius[Dec_R_sequence[k]][Dec_C_sequence[k]]` in the Polybius square, forming the plaintext `P`.

### Breaking the Bifid Cipher (Deducing the Key)

The crucial insight comes from combining the encryption and decryption processes with the known plaintext-ciphertext pair (`plainText1`, `cipherText1`). Let `P1` be `plainText1` and `C1` be `cipherText1` after cleaning. Let `L` be their length.

From **Encryption Step 2**, the `S_digits` sequence is derived from `P1`'s coordinates:
*   `S_digits[k]` is the row coordinate of `P1[k]` for `k` from `0` to `L-1`.
*   `S_digits[k]` is the column coordinate of `P1[k-L]` for `k` from `L` to `2L-1`.

From **Encryption Step 3**, the `S_digits` sequence is used to produce `C1`:
*   `S_digits[2k]` is the row coordinate for looking up `C1[k]`.
*   `S_digits[2k+1]` is the column coordinate for looking up `C1[k]`.

Let `charToCoords(char)` be the function that gives `[row, col]` for a character.
Let `coordsToChar(row, col)` be the function that gives `char` for coordinates.

Combining these facts:
1.  For any character `P_char = P1[k]`, its coordinates are `[S_digits[k], S_digits[k+L]]`. So, `charToCoords(P_char) = [S_digits[k], S_digits[k+L]]`.
2.  For any character `C_char = C1[k]`, its coordinates (the ones used to produce it) are `[S_digits[2k], S_digits[2k+1]]`. So, `charToCoords(C_char) = [S_digits[2k], S_digits[2k+1]]`.

This means `S_digits[j]` (an unknown digit) is constrained by multiple character mappings. For instance:
*   `S_digits[0]` is the row of `P1[0]` AND the row for producing `C1[0]`. Thus, `charToCoords(P1[0])[0]` must equal `charToCoords(C1[0])[0]`. If `P1[0]` is 'F' (4,1) and `C1[0]` is 'U' (4,4) in the example key, their row coordinates are both 4. This implies `S_digits[0]` = 4.
*   `S_digits[1]` is the row of `P1[1]` AND the column for producing `C1[0]`. Thus, `charToCoords(P1[1])[0]` must equal `charToCoords(C1[0])[1]`. If `P1[1]` is 'L' (4,3) and `C1[0]` is 'U' (4,4), their derived values are `L[0]=4` and `U[1]=4`. This implies `S_digits[1]` = 4.

This forms a system of constraints. We can use a constraint propagation approach:

1.  Initialize `S_digits` (an array of `2L` numbers) with `0` (representing an unknown digit).
2.  Initialize `charToCoords` (a Map) as empty.
3.  Initialize `coordsToChar` (a 5x5 array representing the Polybius square) with `null` values.
4.  Enter a loop that continues as long as changes are made:
    *   **Phase 1: Propagate from `charToCoords` to `S_digits`:** For each `k` from `0` to `L-1`, if `charToCoords` already contains `P1[k]` or `C1[k]`, use their known coordinates to try and fill in corresponding values in `S_digits`.
    *   **Phase 2: Propagate from `S_digits` to `charToCoords` and `coordsToChar`:** For each `k`, if the `S_digits` positions corresponding to `P1[k]`'s coordinates (`S_digits[k]`, `S_digits[k+L]`) or `C1[k]`'s coordinates (`S_digits[2k]`, `S_digits[2k+1]`) are known (non-zero), then use these to set the mappings in `charToCoords` and `coordsToChar`.
    *   If any value in `S_digits`, `charToCoords`, or `coordsToChar` changes during these phases, set a `changed` flag to `true`.
5.  The loop terminates when no more changes can be made. At this point, the `charToCoords` and `coordsToChar` (Polybius square) should be sufficiently populated to decrypt `cipherText2`.

### Decryption of `cipherText2`

Once `charToCoords` and `coordsToChar` are derived:
1.  Clean `cipherText2`.
2.  For each character `C2_k` in the cleaned `cipherText2`:
    *   Look up its coordinates `(r', c')` using `charToCoords(C2_k)`.
    *   Store these `r'` values in `Dec_R_sequence` and `c'` values in `Dec_C_sequence`.
3.  For each `k` from `0` to `L2-1`:
    *   The plaintext character `P2_k` is `coordsToChar(Dec_R_sequence[k], Dec_C_sequence[k])`.
4.  Concatenate all `P2_k` to get `plainText2`.

### Edge Cases and Assumptions:
*   The puzzle guarantees that the provided `plainText1`/`cipherText1` pair is sufficient to derive the necessary parts of the key. If any character in `cipherText2` does not have a corresponding entry in the derived `charToCoords` map or `coordsToChar` grid, it would indicate an issue with the derived key or an invalid input.
*   Coordinates are 1-indexed (1 to 5) as per the puzzle description. My code uses 0-indexed arrays internally and converts when interacting with the 1-indexed coordinates.
*   'J' is replaced by 'I'. Spaces are removed. Text is uppercased.
