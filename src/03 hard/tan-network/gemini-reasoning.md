The problem requires finding the shortest path between two stops in a public transportation network, where the "shortest" path is defined by the total geographical distance between consecutive stops. We need to use Dijkstra's algorithm for this, as it's suitable for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   **Stop Information:** We'll parse the input stop data and store it in a `Map<string, Stop>` where the key is the stop's unique identifier and the value is a `Stop` object. The `Stop` object will contain its `id`, `name`, `latitude`, and `longitude`. Crucially, the latitudes and longitudes from the input are in degrees, but the distance formula requires them in radians, so we'll convert them immediately upon parsing.
    *   **Graph Representation (Adjacency List):** The network of routes will be represented as an adjacency list. A `Map<string, Array<{ targetId: string; distance: number }>>` will map each stop ID to a list of its direct neighbors. For each neighbor, we store its ID and the pre-calculated distance to it from the current stop.

2.  **Distance Calculation:**
    *   The problem provides a specific formula for calculating the distance `d` between two points (latitude, longitude):
        `x = (long2 - long1) * cos((lat1 + lat2) / 2)`
        `y = (lat2 - lat1)`
        `d = sqrt(x*x + y*y) * 6371`
    *   It's important to use *this exact formula* and ensure that `lat` and `long` values are in *radians* when used in the formula. The input values are in degrees, so a `toRadians` helper function is necessary.

3.  **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
    *   **Initialization:**
        *   `distances`: A `Map<string, number>` to store the shortest distance found so far from the starting stop to every other stop. All distances are initialized to `Infinity`, except for the `startStopId`, which is `0`.
        *   `previous`: A `Map<string, string>` to keep track of the predecessor stop on the shortest path to a given stop. This is used for path reconstruction.
        *   `priorityQueue`: A Min-Heap data structure to efficiently retrieve the unvisited stop with the smallest known distance. It will store `[distance, stopId]` pairs, prioritized by `distance`.
    *   **Main Loop:**
        *   The algorithm repeatedly extracts the stop with the smallest current distance from the `priorityQueue`.
        *   If this extracted distance is greater than the already recorded shortest distance for that stop, it means a shorter path has already been processed, so we skip it.
        *   If the extracted stop is the `endStopId`, we've found the shortest path, and we can stop.
        *   For each neighbor of the current stop, we calculate a `newDistance` (current stop's distance + distance to neighbor).
        *   If `newDistance` is less than the currently recorded distance to the neighbor, we update the neighbor's distance in the `distances` map, set the current stop as its `previous` stop, and add/update the neighbor in the `priorityQueue`.
    *   **Min-Heap Implementation:** A custom `MinHeap` class is provided to handle priority queue operations (inserting and extracting the minimum element) efficiently, ensuring a good time complexity for Dijkstra's algorithm (O((V + E) log V), where V is stops and E is routes).

4.  **Path Reconstruction:**
    *   After Dijkstra's algorithm completes, if the `distances.get(endStopId)` is still `Infinity`, it means no path exists, and we output "IMPOSSIBLE".
    *   Otherwise, we reconstruct the path by starting from the `endStopId` and backtracking using the `previous` map until we reach the `startStopId`. The names of these stops are collected and then reversed to get the correct order from start to end.
    *   Finally, the full names of the stops along the path are printed, one per line.

**Time Complexity:**
*   Parsing input and building the graph: O(N + M)
*   Dijkstra's algorithm: O((N + M) log N) due to the use of a binary min-heap.
Given N, M < 10000, this complexity is efficient enough for the typical time limits (e.g., 1 second).

**Space Complexity:**
*   Storing stops and graph: O(N + M)
*   Distances, previous, and priority queue: O(N)
This is also well within memory limits.
