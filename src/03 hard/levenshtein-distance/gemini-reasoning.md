The Levenshtein distance, also known as edit distance, measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

**Algorithm (Dynamic Programming Approach)**

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll create a 2D array (matrix), `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the Levenshtein distance between the first `i` characters of string `s1` and the first `j` characters of string `s2`.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `dp[0][0] = 0`: The distance between two empty strings is 0.
    *   `dp[i][0] = i`: To transform the first `i` characters of `s1` into an empty string, we need `i` deletions.
    *   `dp[0][j] = j`: To transform an empty string into the first `j` characters of `s2`, we need `j` insertions.

2.  **Recurrence Relation:**
    For each cell `dp[i][j]` (where `i > 0` and `j > 0`):
    *   **If `s1[i-1]` (the `i`-th character of `s1`) is equal to `s2[j-1]` (the `j`-th character of `s2`):**
        The characters match, so no operation is needed at this step. The distance is simply the distance of the prefixes without these characters: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    *   **If `s1[i-1]` is NOT equal to `s2[j-1]`:**
        We need to perform an operation. We consider three possibilities and take the minimum cost among them, adding 1 for the operation:
        *   **Deletion:** Delete `s1[i-1]`. The cost would be `dp[i-1][j] + 1`.
        *   **Insertion:** Insert `s2[j-1]` into `s1`. The cost would be `dp[i][j-1] + 1`.
        *   **Substitution:** Substitute `s1[i-1]` with `s2[j-1]`. The cost would be `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
        So, `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`.

3.  **Result:**
    The final Levenshtein distance is found in `dp[len1][len2]`, where `len1` is the length of `s1` and `len2` is the length of `s2`.

**Constraints and Complexity:**
The maximum length of the strings is 50. This means the `dp` matrix will be at most `51x51`. The time complexity is O(len1 * len2) and space complexity is O(len1 * len2), which is perfectly efficient for the given constraints.
