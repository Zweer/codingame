The problem asks us to calculate the "Erdős number" for a given scientist. This number represents the minimum "collaborative distance" to the mathematician Paul Erdős, measured by co-authored publications.

*   Paul Erdős himself has an Erdős number of 0.
*   A scientist who co-authored a paper with Erdős has an Erdős number of 1.
*   A scientist who co-authored a paper with someone who has an Erdős number of *k* (and not *k-1*) has an Erdős number of *k+1*.
*   If there is no direct or indirect collaboration, the Erdős number is considered "infinite".
*   If the number is not 0 or infinite, we also need to output the sequence of paper titles that form this shortest collaborative chain, starting from the target scientist's paper and ending with the paper co-authored by Erdős.

This problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is a classic application for Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Graph Representation:**

1.  **Nodes:** Each unique scientist mentioned in the publications will be a node in our graph.
2.  **Edges:** An edge exists between two scientists if they have co-authored at least one paper. Since we are looking for the shortest path in terms of the number of *collaborations*, all edges have an implicit weight of 1.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Parse Input:**
    *   Read the `targetScientist` name.
    *   Read `N`, the number of publications.
    *   Read `N` publication titles.
    *   Read `N` author lists (space-separated strings) corresponding to the titles.

2.  **Build the Collaboration Graph:**
    *   We'll use an `Adjacency List` to represent the graph: `Map<string, Set<string>>` where the key is a scientist's name and the value is a `Set` of their direct collaborators.
    *   To reconstruct the path later, we also need to know *which paper* connects two specific collaborators. A `Map<string, Map<string, string>>` named `connectingPapers` will store this: `connectingPapers.get(scientist1)!.get(scientist2)` will return the title of a paper co-authored by `scientist1` and `scientist2`.
    *   Iterate through each publication:
        *   For each paper, split its author string into individual author names.
        *   For every unique pair of authors within that paper, add them to each other's collaboration sets in the `collaborations` map.
        *   Also, store the paper title in the `connectingPapers` map for both directions (e.g., `scientist1` to `scientist2` and `scientist2` to `scientist1`).

3.  **Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
    *   Initialize `distances: Map<string, number>` to store the Erdős number for each scientist found. Start with `distances.set("Erdős", 0)`.
    *   Initialize `pathInfo: Map<string, { prevScientist: string, paperTitle: string }>` to reconstruct the path. For any `currentScientist`, `pathInfo.get(currentScientist)` will store the `prevScientist` who led to `currentScientist` in the shortest path, and the `paperTitle` that connected them.
    *   Initialize a `queue` with "Erdős".
    *   Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of processed scientists.
    *   **Special Case:** If the `targetScientist` is "Erdős" himself, output `0` and terminate.
    *   Start the BFS loop:
        *   Dequeue `currentScientist`.
        *   Get `currentDistance` from `distances`.
        *   If `currentScientist` is the `targetScientist`, the shortest path is found. Mark `foundTarget = true` and `break` the loop.
        *   For each `collaborator` of `currentScientist`:
            *   If `collaborator` has not been `visited`:
                *   Mark `collaborator` as visited.
                *   Set `distances.set(collaborator, currentDistance + 1)`.
                *   Retrieve the `paperTitle` connecting `currentScientist` and `collaborator` from `connectingPapers`.
                *   Store this connection in `pathInfo.set(collaborator, { prevScientist: currentScientist, paperTitle: paperTitle })`.
                *   Enqueue `collaborator`.

4.  **Output Result:**
    *   If `targetScientist` was not found (i.e., `foundTarget` is `false` or `distances.has(targetScientist)` is `false`), output `infinite`.
    *   Otherwise:
        *   Output the `erdosNumber` (which is `distances.get(targetScientist)`).
        *   Reconstruct the path of paper titles:
            *   Start from `targetScientist` and traverse backwards using the `pathInfo` map until Erdős is reached.
            *   Collect the `paperTitle` at each step. This naturally builds the list of papers in the desired order (from target scientist's paper to Erdős's paper).
            *   Print each collected paper title.

**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**

Input:
```
Einstein
2
"On linear independence of sequences in a Banach space"
"The influence of the expansion of space on the gravitation fields surrounding the individual stars"
Erdős Straus
Straus Einstein
```

1.  **Graph Building:**
    *   Paper 1: `"On linear independence..."` (Authors: "Erdős", "Straus")
        *   `collaborations`: `Erdős -> {Straus}`, `Straus -> {Erdős}`
        *   `connectingPapers`: `Erdős -> (Straus -> "On linear independence...")`, `Straus -> (Erdős -> "On linear independence...")`
    *   Paper 2: `"The influence..."` (Authors: "Straus", "Einstein")
        *   `collaborations`: `Straus -> {Erdős, Einstein}`, `Einstein -> {Straus}` (Erdős's entry remains `Erdős -> {Straus}`)
        *   `connectingPapers`: `Straus -> (Einstein -> "The influence...")`, `Einstein -> (Straus -> "The influence...")` (Existing `Straus -> (Erdős -> ...)` remains)

2.  **BFS (target="Einstein", start="Erdős"):**
    *   `queue = ["Erdős"]`, `distances = {"Erdős": 0}`, `pathInfo = {}`
    *   **Dequeue "Erdős" (dist 0):**
        *   Collaborator: "Straus". Not visited.
        *   `distances.set("Straus", 1)`.
        *   `pathInfo.set("Straus", { prevScientist: "Erdős", paperTitle: "On linear independence..." })`
        *   `queue = ["Straus"]`
    *   **Dequeue "Straus" (dist 1):**
        *   Collaborator: "Erdős". Visited. Skip.
        *   Collaborator: "Einstein". Not visited.
        *   `distances.set("Einstein", 2)`.
        *   `pathInfo.set("Einstein", { prevScientist: "Straus", paperTitle: "The influence..." })`
        *   `queue = ["Einstein"]`
    *   **Dequeue "Einstein" (dist 2):**
        *   `currentScientist` is `targetScientist`. Set `foundTarget = true`, `break`.

3.  **Output:**
    *   Erdős number: `distances.get("Einstein")` is `2`. Output `2`.
    *   Path reconstruction:
        *   `current = "Einstein"`. `pathTitles = []`.
        *   `info = pathInfo.get("Einstein")` is `{ prevScientist: "Straus", paperTitle: "The influence..." }`.
        *   `pathTitles.push("The influence...")`. `current = "Straus"`.
        *   `info = pathInfo.get("Straus")` is `{ prevScientist: "Erdős", paperTitle: "On linear independence..." }`.
        *   `pathTitles.push("On linear independence...")`. `current = "Erdős"`.
        *   `current` is "Erdős", loop terminates.
    *   Output papers:
        *   `"The influence of the expansion of space on the gravitation fields surrounding the individual stars"`
        *   `"On linear independence of sequences in a Banach space"`

This matches the example output.
