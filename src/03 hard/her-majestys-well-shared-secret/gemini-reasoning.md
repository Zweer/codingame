The problem asks us to reconstruct a secret message that has been shared among nine double-zero agents using a variant of Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme. We are given `N` parts of the secret (where `N` is between 2 and 8, inclusive) and need to reveal the original message.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the solution approach:

1.  **Secret Alphabet and Modulo:** The secret message is formed from 53 characters: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_`. Each character is assigned an index from 0 to 52. All calculations must be performed modulo 53. Since 53 is a prime number, we can use modular arithmetic, including modular division (by finding the modular multiplicative inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem).

2.  **Secret Sharing Mechanism:**
    *   The secret message `S` is treated as a sequence of character indices `S[0], S[1], ...`.
    *   For each character `S[i]`, a polynomial `P[i](X)` of degree `k-1` is created: `P[i](X) = A[i,k-1]*X^(k-1) + ... + A[i,1]*X + S[i]`.
    *   Crucially, `S[i]` is the constant term `P[i](0)`. Our goal is to find `P[j](0)` for each character position `j`.
    *   Each agent `00x` (where `x` is from 1 to 9) receives the values `[P[0](x)%53, P[1](x)%53, ...]`. These are the "points" we will use for interpolation.

3.  **Unknown Threshold `k`:** The problem states there's a threshold `k` such that at least `k` parts are necessary. We are given `N` parts, and it's guaranteed that `N >= k`. The value of `k` itself is not provided as input. In such scenarios, the most common interpretation in competitive programming is that `k` is equal to `N`. This means we use all `N` provided points to reconstruct a polynomial of degree `N-1`. This interpretation is consistent with the example provided (where `N=2` and `k=2` is implicitly used).

4.  **Lagrange Interpolation:** To reconstruct the constant term `P[j](0)` for each character `j`, we use Lagrange interpolation. Given `N` points `(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_{N-1}, y_{N-1})` that lie on a polynomial `P(X)` of degree `N-1`, the value `P(0)` can be found using the formula:

    `P(0) = SUM_{idx=0}^{N-1} (y_idx * L_idx(0)) % MOD`

    where `L_idx(0)` is the Lagrange basis polynomial evaluated at `X=0`:

    `L_idx(0) = PRODUCT_{m=0, m!=idx}^{N-1} ((-x_m) / (x_idx - x_m)) % MOD`

    All operations (addition, multiplication, division) must be performed modulo 53.

### Implementation Details:

1.  **Alphabet Mapping:** We create two mappings: `charToIndex` (Map from character to its numerical index) and `indexToChar` (array from index to character) for easy conversion.

2.  **Modular Arithmetic Helpers:**
    *   `power(base, exp, mod)`: Computes `base^exp % mod` efficiently using modular exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring). This is used for finding modular inverses.
    *   `modInverse(n, mod)`: Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` modulo `mod`. For a prime modulus `M`, this is `n^(M-2) % M` by Fermat's Little Theorem.
    *   `modDiv(numerator, denominator, mod)`: Computes `(numerator / denominator) % mod` by multiplying the `numerator` with the modular inverse of the `denominator`. It handles potential negative intermediate results by ensuring all values are positive modulo `mod` before operations.

3.  **Input Parsing:**
    *   Read `N`.
    *   For each of the `N` lines, parse the agent code (e.g., "005" becomes `5`) and convert their secret part string into an array of numerical character indices. Store these `(x, yValues)` pairs.

4.  **Reconstruction Loop:**
    *   Iterate from `j = 0` to `secretLength - 1` (for each character position).
    *   Inside this loop, calculate `P[j](0)` using the Lagrange interpolation formula.
        *   Initialize `sum = 0`.
        *   For each `idx` from `0` to `N-1` (representing each agent's point):
            *   Get `X_idx` (agent number) and `Y_idx` (the `j`-th character value for that agent).
            *   Calculate `product` (which corresponds to `L_idx(0)`). This involves another nested loop from `m = 0` to `N-1` (excluding `m === idx`). In this inner loop, we calculate `(-X_m) / (X_idx - X_m)` using `modDiv` and accumulate it into `product`.
            *   Add `(Y_idx * product) % MOD` to `sum`, ensuring `sum` remains positive modulo `MOD`.
        *   After the loops, `sum` will hold the numerical index of the `j`-th character of the secret. Convert this back to a character and append it to the `revealedSecret` string.

5.  **Output:** Print the `revealedSecret`.

The example input/output pair provided in the problem description has been verified with this algorithm. While a quick initial manual calculation for the first character showed a discrepancy, a more thorough step-by-step trace confirmed that the algorithm's output matches the intermediate values, and the example data indeed leads to "SIS" when properly computed.
