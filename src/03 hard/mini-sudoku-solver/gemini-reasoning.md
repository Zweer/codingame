## Reasoning

The problem asks us to solve a 4x4 Sudoku grid. The rules are standard Sudoku rules adapted for a 4x4 grid:
1.  Each row must contain digits 1-4 exactly once.
2.  Each column must contain digits 1-4 exactly once.
3.  Each of the four 2x2 subgrids (blocks) must contain digits 1-4 exactly once. The 2x2 blocks are:
    *   Top-left: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
    *   Top-right: (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)
    *   Bottom-left: (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)
    *   Bottom-right: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)
Input cells with '0' are empty and need to be filled. The problem guarantees a unique solution and "six hints or more," which suggests that a simple backtracking approach will be efficient enough.

**Algorithm: Backtracking**

The core idea is to try filling empty cells one by one. If a choice leads to a dead end, we backtrack and try another choice.

1.  **Represent the grid:** A 2D array (e.g., `number[][]`) is suitable. Empty cells are represented by `0`.

2.  **`isValid(board, row, col, num)` function:** This helper function is crucial. Before placing a `num` in `(row, col)`, we must check if it violates any Sudoku rules:
    *   **Row check:** Iterate through `board[row]` to see if `num` already exists.
    *   **Column check:** Iterate through `board[col]` (all rows at `col`) to see if `num` already exists.
    *   **2x2 Block check:** Determine the top-left corner of the 2x2 block that `(row, col)` belongs to. For a 4x4 grid, this can be found using `startRow = Math.floor(row / 2) * 2` and `startCol = Math.floor(col / 2) * 2`. Then, iterate through the 2x2 cells within this block to see if `num` already exists.

3.  **`solveSudoku(board)` function (Recursive Backtracker):**
    *   **Base Case:** Iterate through the entire `board` to find an empty cell (`0`). If no empty cell is found, it means the puzzle is solved, so return `true`.
    *   **Recursive Step:**
        *   If an empty cell `(r, c)` is found:
        *   Try placing numbers from 1 to 4 into this cell (`num`).
        *   For each `num`, call `isValid(board, r, c, num)`.
        *   If `isValid` returns `true`:
            *   Place `num` in `board[r][c]`.
            *   Recursively call `solveSudoku(board)`.
            *   If the recursive call returns `true` (meaning a solution was found further down this path), then propagate `true` back up.
            *   If the recursive call returns `false` (meaning `num` at `(r,c)` led to a dead end), then **backtrack**: reset `board[r][c]` to `0` and try the next `num`.
        *   If all numbers (1-4) have been tried for `(r, c)` and none lead to a solution, it means the previous choice was wrong. Return `false` to trigger backtracking in the calling function.

4.  **Input/Output:**
    *   Read 4 lines of input, each representing a row string.
    *   Parse these strings into a `number[][]` grid.
    *   Call `solveSudoku` with the parsed grid.
    *   After `solveSudoku` completes (it modifies the grid in-place), iterate through the solved grid and print each row by joining its numbers back into a string.

This backtracking approach systematically explores all possibilities until it finds the unique solution, which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.
