The problem asks us to identify all buildings in an ASCII art representation of a city skyline, find the maximum height among them, and then print all buildings that match this maximum height, in their original left-to-right order. Buildings are made of `#` characters, have no holes, and are separated by at least one space.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Input Reading:**
    *   Read the width `W` and height `H` of the picture.
    *   Read the `H` lines of the ASCII art into an array of strings, `picture`.

2.  **Building Identification and Extraction:**
    *   We iterate through the picture's columns from left to right (`j` from `0` to `W-1`).
    *   A new building starts when we encounter a `#` character at the bottom row (`picture[H-1][j]`).
    *   Once a building's start column `currentBuildingStartCol` is found, we determine its `currentBuildingEndCol` by scanning right along the bottom row until we hit a space or the end of the picture. The `buildingWidth` is `currentBuildingEndCol - currentBuildingStartCol + 1`.
    *   **Calculating Building Height:** Since there are no holes and buildings extend from the ground up, we can find the building's height by determining its topmost row. We iterate from the top row (`r = 0`) downwards. The first row `r` where any character `picture[r][c]` (where `c` is within the building's `startCol` to `endCol`) is `#` gives us the `topRowIndex`. The building's height is then `H - topRowIndex`.
    *   **Extracting Building's ASCII Art:** Once `topRowIndex` and `currentBuildingStartCol`, `currentBuildingEndCol` are known, we can extract the relevant rows of the building. For each row from `topRowIndex` to `H-1`, we take the substring `picture[r].substring(currentBuildingStartCol, currentBuildingEndCol + 1)`.
    *   Store each identified building as an object containing its `height` and an array of `rows` (its ASCII art). Keep track of the `maxHeight` encountered so far.
    *   After processing a building, we advance our column pointer `j` to `currentBuildingEndCol + 1` to continue scanning from immediately after the just-processed building. If we encounter a space, we simply increment `j` to move to the next column.

3.  **Output Generation:**
    *   Filter the list of all found buildings to keep only those whose `height` matches the `maxHeight`. This preserves their original left-to-right order.
    *   Iterate through this filtered list. For each building, print its `rows`.
    *   Crucially, print an empty line after each building, *unless* it's the very last building in the filtered list. This ensures correct separation as per the example output.

**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**

Input:
```
10 5
          
## ###    
## ###    
## ### ###
## ### ###
```

1.  **Parse Buildings:**
    *   `j = 0`: `picture[4][0]` is `#`. Building starts at `col=0`.
        *   Scans `picture[4]` to find `endCol = 1`. `width = 2`.
        *   `topRowIndex`: `picture[1][0]` is `#`, so `topRowIndex = 1`.
        *   `height = 5 - 1 = 4`.
        *   `rows = ["##", "##", "##", "##"]`.
        *   Store `{ height: 4, rows: [...] }`. `maxHeight = 4`. `j` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
    *   `j = 2`: `picture[4][2]` is ` `. `j` becomes `3`.
    *   `j = 3`: `picture[4][3]` is `#`. Building starts at `col=3`.
        *   Scans `picture[4]` to find `endCol = 5`. `width = 3`.
        *   `topRowIndex`: `picture[1][3]` is `#`, so `topRowIndex = 1`.
        *   `height = 5 - 1 = 4`.
        *   `rows = ["###", "###", "###", "###"]`.
        *   Store `{ height: 4, rows: [...] }`. `maxHeight` remains `4`. `j` becomes `5 + 1 = 6`.
    *   `j = 6`: `picture[4][6]` is ` `. `j` becomes `7`.
    *   `j = 7`: `picture[4][7]` is `#`. Building starts at `col=7`.
        *   Scans `picture[4]` to find `endCol = 9`. `width = 3`.
        *   `topRowIndex`: `picture[3][7]` is `#`, so `topRowIndex = 3`.
        *   `height = 5 - 3 = 2`.
        *   `rows = ["###", "###"]`.
        *   Store `{ height: 2, rows: [...] }`. `maxHeight` remains `4`. `j` becomes `9 + 1 = 10`.
    *   `j = 10`: Loop ends.

2.  **Output:**
    *   Buildings: `[ {H:4, R:["##",..]}, {H:4, R:["###",..]}, {H:2, R:["###",..]} ]`
    *   `maxHeight = 4`.
    *   Filter: `[ {H:4, R:["##",..]}, {H:4, R:["###",..]} ]`
    *   Print first building (`##...`):
        ```
        ##
        ##
        ##
        ##
        ```
        Print empty line (not last).
    *   Print second building (`###...`):
        ```
        ###
        ###
        ###
        ###
        ```
        No empty line (is last).

This matches the desired output.
