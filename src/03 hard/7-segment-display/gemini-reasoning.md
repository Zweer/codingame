The puzzle asks us to print a given number `N` in a large 7-segment display style using a specified character `C` and segment size `S`.

**Understanding 7-Segment Display Structure:**

A 7-segment display uses 7 distinct segments to form digits. We can label them as follows:

```
  aaa
 f   b
 f   b
  ggg
 e   c
 e   c
  ddd
```

Where:
*   `a` is the top horizontal segment (index 0)
*   `f` is the top-left vertical segment (index 1)
*   `b` is the top-right vertical segment (index 2)
*   `g` is the middle horizontal segment (index 3)
*   `e` is the bottom-left vertical segment (index 4)
*   `c` is the bottom-right vertical segment (index 5)
*   `d` is the bottom horizontal segment (index 6)

**Dimensions of a Digit:**

Given a segment size `S`:
*   **Horizontal segments** (`a`, `g`, `d`) have a length of `S` characters. Including the padding spaces on either side for vertical segments, they span `1 + S + 1 = S + 2` characters wide.
*   **Vertical segments** (`f`, `b`, `e`, `c`) span `S` lines each.

Therefore, for a single digit:
*   **Total Width:** `S + 2` characters (as specified in the problem).
*   **Total Height:**
    *   1 line for top segment (`a`)
    *   `S` lines for top vertical segments (`f`, `b`)
    *   1 line for middle segment (`g`)
    *   `S` lines for bottom vertical segments (`e`, `c`)
    *   1 line for bottom segment (`d`)
    *   Total height = `1 + S + 1 + S + 1 = 2*S + 3` lines.

**Approach:**

1.  **Define Segment Patterns:** Create a mapping (e.g., an object or array) that specifies which segments are active (ON) for each digit from 0 to 9.
2.  **Generate Single Digit Display:** Implement a function `generateDigitDisplay(digit, char, S)` that returns an array of strings, where each string represents a line of the rendered digit. This function will use the segment patterns and fill characters (`C`) or spaces to construct each line based on the calculated dimensions.
    *   Horizontal segments will be `C.repeat(S)` if active, otherwise `' '.repeat(S)`. They will be surrounded by single spaces for alignment.
    *   Vertical segments will be `C` if active, otherwise `' '`. They will be separated by `S` spaces.
3.  **Process Input and Combine Digits:**
    *   Read `N` as a string to handle potentially large numbers (up to 10^10 - 1).
    *   Convert the `N` string into an array of individual digits.
    *   For each digit, call `generateDigitDisplay` to get its 7-segment representation (an array of lines). Store these in a 2D array, where `allDigitDisplays[digitIndex][lineIndex]` holds the string for a specific line of a specific digit.
    *   Iterate from line 0 up to `totalHeight - 1`. For each line, concatenate the corresponding line string from each digit's display, separating them with a single space. Print the combined line.

**Example Walkthrough (N=8, C='#', S=2):**

*   `S=2`: Width = 4, Height = 7.
*   Digit `8` uses all segments: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
*   `charHorizontal` (`#`.repeat(2)) = `##`
*   `spaceHorizontal` (` `.repeat(2)) = `  `

Generated lines for `8`:
*   Line 0 (Top): `' ' + '##' + ' '` => ` ## `
*   Line 1 (Vertical): `'#' + '  ' + '#'` => `#  #` (from S lines for f/b)
*   Line 2 (Vertical): `'#' + '  ' + '#'` => `#  #` (from S lines for f/b)
*   Line 3 (Middle): `' ' + '##' + ' '` => ` ## `
*   Line 4 (Vertical): `'#' + '  ' + '#'` => `#  #` (from S lines for e/c)
*   Line 5 (Vertical): `'#' + '  ' + '#'` => `#  #` (from S lines for e/c)
*   Line 6 (Bottom): `' ' + '##' + ' '` => ` ## `

This perfectly matches the example output.
