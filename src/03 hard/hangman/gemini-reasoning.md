The Hangman puzzle requires us to simulate a game of Hangman as the moderator. We are given the target word/sentence and a sequence of guessed letters. We need to track mistakes and correctly revealed letters, then output the final hangman ASCII art and the current state of the guessed word.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Input Processing**:
    *   Read the `entry` word/sentence.
    *   Read the space-separated list of `guesses` and split it into an array of individual characters.

2.  **Game State Initialization**:
    *   `mistakes`: An integer counter, initialized to `0`. It tracks the number of incorrect guesses. The game ends (or the hangman is fully drawn) after 6 mistakes.
    *   `originalEntryLowercase`: The target `entry` converted to lowercase. This allows for case-insensitive matching of guesses.
    *   `guessedLetters`: A `Set<string>` to store *all* unique letters that have been attempted so far, whether correct or incorrect. This is crucial for handling repeated guesses, which are always considered errors.
    *   `revealedLetters`: A `Set<string>` to store only the letters that are part of the `originalEntryLowercase` and have been correctly guessed. This set helps reconstruct the visible part of the word.

3.  **Hangman ASCII Art**:
    *   A 2D array `hangmanArt` is pre-defined to store the 4 lines of ASCII art for each possible mistake count (0 to 6). This allows easy retrieval based on the `mistakes` count. Important: The problem specifies no trailing whitespace on output lines, so the art strings are crafted precisely.

4.  **Game Simulation Loop**:
    *   Iterate through each `guessChar` in the `guesses` array.
    *   For each `guessChar`:
        *   **Check for Repeated Guess**: If `guessChar` is already present in the `guessedLetters` set, it's a repeated guess. According to the rules, repeated guesses are always errors, so `mistakes` is incremented.
        *   **New Guess**: If `guessChar` is not in `guessedLetters`:
            *   Add `guessChar` to `guessedLetters` to mark it as tried.
            *   Check if `originalEntryLowercase` contains `guessChar`.
                *   If yes, it's a correct guess. Add `guessChar` to `revealedLetters`.
                *   If no, it's an incorrect guess. Increment `mistakes`.

5.  **Output Generation**:
    *   **Hangman Art**: The number of mistakes can exceed 6 internally, but the hangman art only has states up to 6. So, `Math.min(mistakes, 6)` is used as an index to select the appropriate hangman drawing from `hangmanArt`. The 4 lines corresponding to this index are printed.
    *   **Guessed Word**:
        *   An empty string `displayWord` is initialized.
        *   Iterate through each character (`char`) of `originalEntryLowercase`:
            *   If `char` is a space (`' '`), append a space to `displayWord` (spaces are always revealed).
            *   If `char` is present in `revealedLetters`, append `char` to `displayWord` (it's a correctly guessed letter).
            *   Otherwise (it's a letter not yet revealed), append an underscore (`_`) to `displayWord`.
        *   Finally, print `displayWord`.

This approach ensures all rules are followed, including handling repeated guesses as errors and displaying the correct hangman state and word progress.
