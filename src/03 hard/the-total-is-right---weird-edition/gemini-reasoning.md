The problem asks us to find the minimum number of copies of a given integer `a` required to form a target integer `N`, using the four basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and parentheses. Division is only allowed if the result is an integer. We are given constraints: `1 < N <= 10000`, `1 <= a <= 100`, and the `solution <= 12`.

This is a classic "target number" puzzle that can be modeled as a shortest path problem on a graph. The nodes of the graph are the numbers we can form, and the "edge weights" are the additional copies of `a` used in an operation. Since we want the minimum number of `a`'s, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm is appropriate.

**Algorithm Design:**

1.  **State Representation:** Each state in our search will be `(value, count)`, where `value` is an integer obtained, and `count` is the minimum number of `a`'s used to obtain that `value`.

2.  **`minCounts` Map:** We'll use a `Map<number, number>` called `minCounts` to store the minimum `count` found so far for each `value`. Initialize `minCounts` with `a` itself: `minCounts.set(a, 1)`.

3.  **Queue for BFS/Dijkstra:** We'll use a queue to manage the states to explore. A simple array `[value, count][]` can act as a queue, processed with a `head` pointer for efficiency (avoiding `shift()`). Initially, `queue` contains `[a, 1]`.

4.  **Value Bounds:** The constraints `N <= 10000` and `a <= 100`, along with `solution <= 12`, imply that intermediate values shouldn't explode to astronomical sizes.
    *   Example analysis shows intermediate values often near `N + a` or `N * (small factor of a)`.
    *   If `N = X/Y`, then `X = N*Y`. If `Y` is `a` (1 `a`), then `X` could be `N*a`.
    *   Max `N*a` = `10000 * 100 = 1,000,000`. So, values up to `1,000,000` (and down to `-1,000,000` for negative results from subtraction) might need to be tracked.
    *   We set `VALUE_BOUND = 1,000,000`. Any generated value outside `[-VALUE_BOUND, VALUE_BOUND]` is discarded.

5.  **BFS/Dijkstra Logic:**
    *   Initialize `minOverallSolution = Infinity`.
    *   Loop while the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue `[val1, count1]`.
        *   **Pruning 1:** If `count1` is greater than `minCounts.get(val1)`, it means we've already found a shorter path to `val1`. Skip this state.
        *   **Goal Check:** If `val1` is equal to `N`, update `minOverallSolution = Math.min(minOverallSolution, count1)`. Since this is a shortest path algorithm, the first time `N` is dequeued, it usually represents the minimum. However, due to `count1 + count2` operations, paths might not strictly increase count by 1 at each step. So, updating `minOverallSolution` and continuing allows exploration of all relevant paths.
        *   **Pruning 2:** If `count1` is already `12` or more (the maximum allowed solution), or `count1` is already greater than or equal to `minOverallSolution` (a better path already found), stop extending this path.
        *   **Generate New States:** For each `[val2, count2]` pair already in `minCounts`:
            *   Calculate `newCount = count1 + count2`.
            *   **Pruning 3:** If `newCount` exceeds `12` or `minOverallSolution`, skip this combination.
            *   Apply all four arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) between `val1` and `val2` (and `val2` and `val1` for subtraction/division).
            *   For division, check `val2 !== 0` and `val1 % val2 === 0` (and vice-versa).
            *   For each `newVal` generated:
                *   **Pruning 4:** If `Math.abs(newVal)` exceeds `VALUE_BOUND`, discard it.
                *   If `newVal` is not in `minCounts` or `newCount` is strictly less than `minCounts.get(newVal)`:
                    *   Update `minCounts.set(newVal, newCount)`.
                    *   Enqueue `[newVal, newCount]`.

6.  **Return:** After the queue is empty, `minOverallSolution` will hold the minimum number of `a`'s to reach `N`.

**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **State Space:** The number of distinct `value`s we track is bounded by `2 * VALUE_BOUND`, which is `2 * 10^6`.
*   **Operations per Node:** When `[val1, count1]` is dequeued, we iterate over all `val2` in `minCounts`. In the worst case, `minCounts` can hold up to `2 * 10^6` entries. For each `val2`, we perform a constant number of arithmetic operations (up to 6).
*   **Total Operations:** This leads to a complexity roughly proportional to `D * V_actual^2`, where `D` is the max solution depth (12) and `V_actual` is the actual number of distinct values discovered and stored in `minCounts`.
    If `V_actual` is small (e.g., a few thousands), `12 * (2000)^2 = 4.8 * 10^7`, which could pass within typical time limits (1-2 seconds). The key is that `V_actual` is much smaller than `2 * VALUE_BOUND`. The problem constraints suggest that the test cases are specifically designed for `V_actual` to be small.

This approach is a common and effective way to solve "number game" puzzles under such constraints.
