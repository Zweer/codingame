The puzzle asks us to find the largest integer possible by repeatedly swapping any two adjacent digits, provided they have different parities (one even, one odd). Swaps between digits of the same parity (e.g., two even digits or two odd digits) are not allowed.

## Reasoning

The core constraint is that adjacent digits can only be swapped if they have different parities. This implies a very important property: **the relative order of any two digits of the same parity can never change.**

Let's illustrate this:
Suppose we have digits `A` and `B` with the same parity (e.g., both even).
- If `A` and `B` are adjacent (`... A B ...`), they cannot swap directly because they have the same parity.
- If there's a digit `X` between them (`... A X B ...`), for `A` to move past `B`, it would have to swap with `X` first (`... X A B ...`), and then `A` would need to swap with `B`. But `A` and `B` cannot swap. Similarly, `B` cannot move past `A`.
- If `X` moves out of the way (e.g., `... A X B ...` becomes `... A B X ...` by `X` swapping with `B`), then `A` and `B` become adjacent. But again, they cannot swap.

This crucial insight simplifies the problem significantly:
1. All the odd digits will always maintain their original relative order.
2. All the even digits will always maintain their original relative order.

For example, if the input is `325`:
- The odd digits are `3`, `5`. Their relative order will always be `3` then `5`.
- The even digits are `2`. Its relative order doesn't apply here, as there's only one.

We effectively have two ordered sequences: one for odd digits and one for even digits. Our goal is to merge these two sequences into a single sequence that represents the largest possible number. To maximize the number, we should try to place larger digits in more significant (leftmost) positions.

This is a classic "merge" problem, similar to the merge step in merge sort, but instead of sorting, we're building the largest number. At each step, we compare the first available digit from the odd sequence with the first available digit from the even sequence. The larger of the two digits should be chosen and appended to our result, as it contributes most to making the number larger. If the digits are equal, it doesn't matter which one we pick first, as they contribute equally, but we must advance the pointer for the chosen digit's sequence.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the input integer `N` as a string.
2.  **Separate Digits:** Iterate through the characters of `N`. If a character represents an odd digit, add it to an `oddDigits` list. If it represents an even digit, add it to an `evenDigits` list. This preserves their original relative order.
3.  **Merge:**
    *   Initialize two pointers, `oddPtr` and `evenPtr`, both starting at `0`.
    *   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the characters of the maximized number.
    *   While both `oddPtr` is within bounds of `oddDigits` and `evenPtr` is within bounds of `evenDigits`:
        *   Convert the current `oddDigits[oddPtr]` and `evenDigits[evenPtr]` to numbers for comparison.
        *   If the odd digit is greater than the even digit, append the odd digit (as a character) to `result` and increment `oddPtr`.
        *   Otherwise (if the even digit is greater than or equal to the odd digit), append the even digit (as a character) to `result` and increment `evenPtr`.
4.  **Append Remaining:** After the loop, one of the lists might have remaining digits (e.g., if all odd digits were used up first). Append all remaining digits from whichever list still has them to `result`.
5.  **Output:** Join the characters in `result` to form a string and print it.

**Example: `N = 325`**

1.  `nStr = "325"`
2.  `oddDigits = ['3', '5']`
    `evenDigits = ['2']`
3.  `oddPtr = 0`, `evenPtr = 0`, `result = []`
    *   Compare `oddDigits[0]` ('3') and `evenDigits[0]` ('2'). `3 > 2`.
        `result = ['3']`, `oddPtr = 1`.
    *   Now, `oddPtr` is `1`, `evenPtr` is `0`.
        Compare `oddDigits[1]` ('5') and `evenDigits[0]` ('2'). `5 > 2`.
        `result = ['3', '5']`, `oddPtr = 2`.
4.  `oddPtr` is now `2`, which is out of bounds for `oddDigits`. The loop terminates.
5.  Append remaining `evenDigits` (from `evenPtr = 0` to end): `['2']`.
    `result = ['3', '5', '2']`.
6.  `result.join('')` is `"352"`.

This approach ensures that we always pick the largest available digit that maintains the relative order constraints of same-parity digits, thus constructing the overall largest possible number. The time complexity will be O(L) where L is the number of digits, as we iterate through the digits a constant number of times.
