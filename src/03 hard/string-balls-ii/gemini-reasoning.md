The problem "String Balls II" asks us to count the number of strings `p` (of the same length as a given `center` string and consisting of lowercase English letters) such that the sum of character-wise distances `d(center[i], p[i])` is less than or equal to a given `radius`. The result should be output modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Understanding the Distance Metric:**

1.  **Character Distance `d(char1, char2)`**: This is defined as the absolute difference of their 0-indexed positions in the alphabet (`a=0, b=1, ..., z=25`). For example, `d('b', 'd') = |1 - 3| = 2`.
2.  **String Distance `d(string1, string2)`**: For strings of equal length, it's the sum of pairwise character distances. `d("fb", "fd") = d('f','f') + d('b','d') = 0 + 2 = 2`.

**Problem Constraints and Complexity:**

*   `0 < radius <= 100000`
*   `0 < length(center) <= 5000`
*   The final answer must be modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Let `L` be the length of the `center` string.
We need to find the number of strings `p` such that `sum_{i=0}^{L-1} d(center[i], p[i]) <= radius`.

This problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem. Let `dp[r]` be the number of ways to achieve a total distance of `r` using a prefix of the `center` string.

**DP State and Transitions:**

1.  **`dp[r]`**: Number of ways to form a string `p'` of length `k` (prefix of `p`) such that `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} d(center[j], p'[j]) = r`.

2.  **Initialization**: `dp[0] = 1` (There's one way to achieve a sum of 0, by considering no characters yet). All other `dp[r]` are 0.

3.  **Iteration**: We iterate through each character `c_k` in the `center` string (from index `0` to `L-1`). For each `c_k`, we need to update the `dp` array.
    Let `pos` be the 0-indexed position of `c_k` in the alphabet (`'a'` is 0, `'b'` is 1, etc.).
    For each possible character `p_k` that can be chosen at this position, we can calculate `diff_val = d(c_k, p_k)`. The `diff_val` can range from 0 to 25.
    For a given `c_k`, we need to know how many characters `x` result in `d(c_k, x) = diff_val`. Let's precompute this into `char_options[pos][diff_val]`.

    The transition is as follows: to compute `next_dp[new_sum]`, we consider all `current_sum` values from the previous step. If `dp[current_sum]` ways lead to `current_sum`, and `char_options[pos][diff_val]` ways lead to `diff_val` for the current character, then `dp[current_sum] * char_options[pos][diff_val]` ways will lead to `current_sum + diff_val`.
    `next_dp[new_sum] = (next_dp[new_sum] + dp[current_sum] * char_options[pos][diff_val]) % MOD`
    After processing all `current_sum` and `diff_val` combinations for `c_k`, `dp` is updated to `next_dp`.

4.  **Final Result**: After iterating through all `L` characters in `center`, the total number of points inside the ball is the sum of `dp[r]` for all `r` from `0` to `radius`.

**Precomputation of `char_options`:**

For each character `c` (represented by its 0-indexed position `pos` from 0 to 25):
`char_options[pos]` is an array of size 26 (for `diff_val` from 0 to 25).
For each possible character `p_char_idx` (0 to 25):
  `diff = Math.abs(pos - p_char_idx)`
  `char_options[pos][diff]++`

**Complexity Analysis:**

*   Precomputation: `26 * 26 = 676` operations. (Constant time)
*   DP loop:
    *   Outer loop: `L` iterations (for each character in `center`).
    *   Middle loop: `radius + 1` iterations (for `current_sum`).
    *   Inner loop: `26` iterations (for `diff_val`).
    *   Total complexity: `O(L * radius * 26)`.

Given `L <= 5000` and `radius <= 100000`, the worst-case complexity is `5000 * 100000 * 26 = 1.3 * 10^10`. This is too slow for typical time limits (usually around `10^8` operations).

**The "Handpicked" Constraint and Optimization:**

The problem statement includes a crucial note: "All string balls presented here have been handpicked and are guaranteed to be countable in a reasonable amount of time." This strongly suggests that the actual test cases will not hit the theoretical worst-case `L * radius` product. Instead, it implies that:
1.  When `L` is large (e.g., `L=5000`), `radius` will be small enough (e.g., `radius <= 500`), resulting in `5000 * 500 * 26 = 6.5 * 10^7` operations, which is feasible.
2.  When `radius` is large (e.g., `radius=100000`), `L` will be small enough (e.g., `L <= 100`), resulting in `100 * 100000 * 26 = 2.6 * 10^8` operations, which might be acceptable for TypeScript.

**Edge Case: `radius >= maxPossibleSum`**

The maximum possible sum of distances for a string of length `L` occurs when `center[i]` and `p[i]` are maximally distant for all `i` (e.g., `'a'` and `'z'`). This sum is `L * 25`.
If `radius` is greater than or equal to `L * 25`, then *any* string `p` of length `L` (composed of lowercase English letters) will satisfy the condition `d(center, p) <= radius`.
In this scenario, for each of the `L` positions, we can choose any of the 26 lowercase English letters. So the total number of points is `26^L`. This case can be handled directly using modular exponentiation, which is much faster.

**Final Algorithm:**

1.  Define `MOD = 1000000007`.
2.  Implement a modular exponentiation function `power(base, exp)` for calculating `base^exp % MOD`.
3.  Read `radius` and `center`.
4.  Calculate `L = center.length`.
5.  Calculate `maxPossibleSum = L * 25`.
6.  If `radius >= maxPossibleSum`, print `power(26, L)` and exit.
7.  Otherwise, proceed with the DP approach:
    a.  Precompute `char_options[pos][diff_val]` for `pos` from 0 to 25 and `diff_val` from 0 to 25.
    b.  Initialize `dp = new Array(radius + 1).fill(0)` and set `dp[0] = 1`.
    c.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `L-1` (for each character in `center`):
        i.   Get `char_code_pos` for `center[i]`.
        ii.  Create `next_dp = new Array(radius + 1).fill(0)`.
        iii. Iterate `current_sum` from `0` to `radius`:
            If `dp[current_sum]` is 0, continue.
            Iterate `diff_val` from `0` to `25`:
                If `char_options[char_code_pos][diff_val]` is 0, continue.
                Calculate `new_sum = current_sum + diff_val`.
                If `new_sum <= radius`:
                    `next_dp[new_sum] = (next_dp[new_sum] + dp[current_sum] * char_options[char_code_pos][diff_val]) % MOD`.
        iv.  Set `dp = next_dp`.
    d.  Calculate `total_points = sum(dp[r] for r from 0 to radius) % MOD`.
    e.  Print `total_points`.
