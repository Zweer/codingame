The problem asks us to find the optimal placement for a given Tetris shape on a pre-existing playfield. The goal is to find the lowest possible position (smallest Y-coordinate) that results in the maximum number of cleared lines. If there's a tie in cleared lines and Y-coordinate, the smallest X-coordinate should be chosen. The shape cannot be rotated.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Coordinate System Interpretation:**
    *   The problem states: "The Y axis starts at 0 on the bottom line of the playfield and increases upwards." This is crucial. So, `Y=0` is the very bottom row, and `Y=FH-1` is the very top row.
    *   The input for the playfield (and shape) is given from top to bottom. To align with the `Y=0` at bottom convention, we must store the playfield rows in reverse order of input. If `FH` lines are read `L0, L1, ..., L(FH-1)` (where `L0` is the topmost), then `L(FH-1)` corresponds to `Y=0`, `L(FH-2)` to `Y=1`, and so on. So, the `i`-th input line should be stored at `playfield[FH - 1 - i]`.
    *   The output `X Y` refers to "the position of the top-left corner of the shape in the playfield". Given the Y-axis increases upwards, this means `Y` is the highest Y-coordinate covered by the shape's bounding box. `X` is the leftmost X-coordinate.

2.  **Shape and Playfield Representation:**
    *   Both the shape and playfield can be represented as 2D arrays of characters (e.g., `string[][]`) where `'*'` denotes a block and `'.'` denotes an empty space.

3.  **Determining Placement Coordinates:**
    *   Let `SW` be the shape's width and `SH` be its height.
    *   Let `FW` be the playfield's width and `FH` be its height.
    *   **Horizontal (X):** The leftmost column `X` can range from `0` to `FW - SW`.
    *   **Vertical (Y):** `Y` is the Y-coordinate of the shape's topmost row.
        *   The shape's lowest row will be at `Y - SH + 1`. This must be greater than or equal to `0`. So, `Y - SH + 1 >= 0` implies `Y >= SH - 1`.
        *   The shape's topmost row `Y` must be less than or equal to `FH - 1`. So, `Y <= FH - 1`.
        *   Therefore, `Y` ranges from `SH - 1` to `FH - 1`.
    *   Mapping a shape block `shape[sr][sc]` (where `sr` is the 0-indexed row from the top of the shape, `sc` is the 0-indexed column from the left of the shape) to playfield coordinates `(px, py)`:
        *   `px = X + sc`
        *   `py = Y - sr` (Since `Y` is the top row, `py` decreases as `sr` increases).

4.  **Simulation and Line Clearing:**
    *   For each possible `(X, Y)` placement:
        *   Create a deep copy of the `initialPlayfield` to simulate the placement independently.
        *   Iterate through each block `shape[sr][sc]` that is `'*'`:
            *   Calculate its corresponding `(px, py)` in the `simulatedPlayfield`.
            *   Set `simulatedPlayfield[py][px] = '*'`. The problem statement "you do not need to ensure that a path effectively exists or that the shape is effectively resting on another one" implies we just place the blocks, even if they would overlap existing blocks (effectively merging/overwriting, but since the goal is to fill lines, it's usually filling empty spots).
        *   After placing the shape, iterate through all rows `r` from `0` to `FH-1` in the `simulatedPlayfield`.
            *   Check if row `r` is completely filled with `'*'`.
            *   If it is, increment `currentClearedLines`.
            *   Note: The problem doesn't mention gravity or cascading clears. It simply asks for the total number of lines that *would* be cleared *after* placement.

5.  **Finding the Best Position (Tie-breaking):**
    *   Initialize `maxClearedLines` to -1 (or 0, as the problem guarantees at least one line can be cleared), and `bestX`, `bestY` to sentinel values (e.g., -1).
    *   Iterate `Y` from `SH-1` upwards (to prioritize lower Ys).
    *   Iterate `X` from `0` upwards (to prioritize lower Xs).
    *   Compare `currentClearedLines` with `maxClearedLines`:
        *   If `currentClearedLines > maxClearedLines`: Update `maxClearedLines`, `bestX`, `bestY`.
        *   If `currentClearedLines === maxClearedLines`:
            *   If `currentY < bestY`: Update `bestY`, `bestX`. (Lower Y is preferred).
            *   If `currentY === bestY`:
                *   If `currentX < bestX`: Update `bestX`. (Lower X is preferred).
    *   A flag `firstCandidateProcessed` can be used to handle the initialization of `bestX, bestY, maxClearedLines` with the first valid placement encountered, simplifying subsequent comparisons.

**Example Walkthrough (re-verified with new coordinate system):**
Input:
Shape 2x2:
`**`
`**`

Playfield 10x4:
`..........` (Y=3)
`..........` (Y=2)
`*****..***` (Y=1)
`*****..***` (Y=0)

Internal `initialPlayfield` (0-indexed bottom-up):
`initialPlayfield[0] = ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '.', '.', '*', '*', '*']`
`initialPlayfield[1] = ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '.', '.', '*', '*', '*']`
`initialPlayfield[2] = ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']`
`initialPlayfield[3] = ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']`

Consider `X=5, Y=1` (from example output). `SH=2`.
`Y` is `1` (top row of shape) -> valid since `SH-1=1 <= 1 <= FH-1=3`.
Shape blocks:
*   `shape[0][0]` (`*`, top-left) -> `px = 5+0 = 5`, `py = 1-0 = 1`. Set `simulatedPlayfield[1][5] = '*'`.
*   `shape[0][1]` (`*`, top-right) -> `px = 5+1 = 6`, `py = 1-0 = 1`. Set `simulatedPlayfield[1][6] = '*'`.
*   `shape[1][0]` (`*`, bottom-left) -> `px = 5+0 = 5`, `py = 1-1 = 0`. Set `simulatedPlayfield[0][5] = '*'`.
*   `shape[1][1]` (`*`, bottom-right) -> `px = 5+1 = 6`, `py = 1-1 = 0`. Set `simulatedPlayfield[0][6] = '*'`.

After placement at `(X=5, Y=1)`:
`simulatedPlayfield[0]` (Y=0): `**********` (Original `.` at index 5,6 are now `'*'`) -> FULL
`simulatedPlayfield[1]` (Y=1): `**********` (Original `.` at index 5,6 are now `'*'`) -> FULL
`simulatedPlayfield[2]` (Y=2): `..........`
`simulatedPlayfield[3]` (Y=3): `..........`

Lines cleared: 2 (`Y=0` and `Y=1`). This matches the example output!
