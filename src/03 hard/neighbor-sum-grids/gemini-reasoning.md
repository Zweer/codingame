The problem asks us to complete a partially filled 5x5 grid. The grid must contain each number from 1 to 25 exactly once. The core rule is that any value `V >= 3` in the grid must be obtainable as the sum of two distinct values among its direct neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). We are guaranteed that a unique solution exists for each test case.

This problem is a classic Constraint Satisfaction Problem, well-suited for a backtracking (Depth-First Search) algorithm.

**1. State Representation:**
*   `grid[5][5]`: A 2D array to represent the 5x5 matrix. `0` indicates an unknown value.
*   `usedNumbers[26]`: A boolean array (1-indexed) to keep track of numbers from 1 to 25 that have already been placed in the grid.

**2. Backtracking Algorithm (`solve` function):**

*   **Base Case:** If all cells in the grid are filled (no `0`s remain), we have a candidate solution. At this point, we perform a **full validation** of the grid.
    *   For every cell `(r, c)` in the grid:
        *   Let `V = grid[r][c]`.
        *   If `V < 3`, the neighbor-sum rule does not apply, so we skip it.
        *   If `V >= 3`, we retrieve all its direct neighbors' values. We then check if `V` can be formed by summing any two distinct values from these neighbors. If no such pair exists, the grid is invalid, and we backtrack.
    *   If all cells `V >= 3` pass this validation, we've found the unique solution. We store a deep copy of this `grid` in a global `solutionGrid` variable and return `true`.

*   **Recursive Step:**
    1.  **Find Next Empty Cell:** Locate the first cell `(emptyR, emptyC)` with a `0` value (e.g., by scanning row by row).
    2.  **Try Numbers:** Iterate through numbers `val` from 1 to 25.
        *   If `val` has not been used yet (`!usedNumbers[val]`):
            *   Place `val` at `grid[emptyR][emptyC]`.
            *   Mark `val` as used (`usedNumbers[val] = true`).
            *   **Pruning (Partial Validation):** This is crucial for performance. After placing `val`, we check for immediate inconsistencies. We identify all cells (the newly placed `val` itself, and its direct neighbors) that *now* have all their neighbors filled. For each such cell `(r, c)` with value `cellValue >= 3`, we perform the neighbor-sum check. If any of these cells fail the check, the current path is invalid, and we immediately `break` and try the next `val`. This avoids exploring branches that are guaranteed to fail.
            *   **Recursive Call:** If the current state is still valid (no pruning occurred), recursively call `solve(grid, usedNumbers)`.
            *   **Success:** If the recursive call returns `true` (meaning a solution was found down this path), propagate `true` upwards.
            *   **Backtrack:** If the recursive call returns `false` (no solution down this path) or the pruning step failed, reset `grid[emptyR][emptyC]` to `0` and `usedNumbers[val]` to `false` to explore other possibilities.

**3. Helper Functions:**
*   `getNeighbors(r, c)`: Returns a list of `{r, c}` coordinates for all valid direct neighbors of a given cell, handling grid boundaries (corner cells have 3 neighbors, border cells have 5, inner cells have 8).

**4. Main Execution Flow:**
*   Read the initial 5x5 grid input.
*   Initialize `usedNumbers` based on the pre-filled values.
*   Call `solve(initialGrid, usedNumbers)`.
*   After `solve` completes, print the `solutionGrid` (which will be populated because a unique solution is guaranteed).

**Optimizations:**
*   **Early Exit:** A global `solutionGrid` variable is used. Once `solve` finds a solution, it sets `solutionGrid` and all subsequent recursive calls immediately return `true` without further computation, effectively stopping the search.
*   **Aggressive Pruning:** The intermediate validity check (described in step 2. Recursive Step, Pruning) significantly reduces the search space by identifying invalid branches as early as possible. This is vital for a 10! or larger initial search space. It specifically checks cells that have become "fully defined" by having all their neighbors filled, and verifies their sum rule.
