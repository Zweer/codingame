The problem asks us to construct the "greatest number" possible using a given set of characters, which can include digits (0-9), a minus sign (`-`), and a decimal dot (`.`). Several specific rules must be followed:

1.  **Use all characters:** All input characters must be used in constructing the number. However, this is implicitly qualified by other rules, e.g., redundant zeros are removed, and a dot might not be used if it violates a rule or results in a numerically equivalent simpler form.
2.  **Greatest number:** This implies:
    *   If a minus sign is present, the number must be negative. To be the "greatest" negative number, its absolute value must be the *smallest*.
    *   If no minus sign is present, the number must be positive. To be the "greatest" positive number, its value should be as large as possible.
3.  **Decimal dot rule:**
    *   "The dot alone must not end a number, at least a digit is needed. For example, `98742.` is refused, write `9874.2` instead." This is a crucial rule. It suggests that if a dot is available and is the only way to satisfy "using all characters" while avoiding a trailing dot, we must place a digit after it. For positive numbers, this means if all digits are `D` and a dot is present, the format `D_prefix . D_last_digit` (e.g., `9874.2`) is preferred over `D` (e.g., `98742`), even if `D` is numerically greater. This is a format constraint, not a numerical one.
4.  **Trailing and leading zeros removal:**
    *   ` -4.0000` becomes `-4`.
    *   ` -5.6500` becomes `-5.65`.
    *   This means redundant zeros in the fractional part are removed, and if the fractional part becomes empty, the dot is also removed. Leading zeros (e.g., `0123`) are removed unless the number is `0` or starts `0.` (e.g., `0.123`).

**Algorithm Breakdown:**

1.  **Parse Input:**
    *   Read `N` (though not strictly used in the logic, as `chars` array implicitly defines count).
    *   Read the space-separated characters into an array.
    *   Identify the presence of `hasMinus` and `hasDot` flags.
    *   Collect all digit characters into a `digits` array (as strings).

2.  **Handle All Zeros Special Case:**
    *   If all collected digits are '0's (e.g., `0`, `0 0`, `0 . -`), the result is always `0`. Print `0` and exit.

3.  **Construct Number Based on Sign:**

    *   **If `hasMinus` (Negative Number - Smallest Absolute Value):**
        *   Sort the `digits` array in **ascending** order (`'0'` to `'9'`). This ensures the smallest digits come first for the smallest absolute value.
        *   Initialize `resultParts` with `"-"`.
        *   Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the sorted `digits`.
        *   **If `hasDot` is true:**
            *   Take the smallest non-zero digit (if present) and append it to `resultParts`. This forms the single-digit integer part of the absolute value (e.g., `2` in `-2.45889`).
            *   Remove this digit from `digits`.
            *   Append `.` to `resultParts`.
            *   Append all remaining `digits` (which are still in ascending order) to `resultParts`. This forms the fractional part.
        *   **If `hasDot` is false:**
            *   Take the smallest non-zero digit (if present) and append it to `resultParts`.
            *   Remove this digit from `digits`.
            *   Append all remaining `digits` (including zeros) to `resultParts`. This forms the rest of the integer part.

    *   **If `!hasMinus` (Positive Number - Greatest Value):**
        *   Sort the `digits` array in **descending** order (`'9'` to `'0'`).
        *   **If `hasDot` is true:**
            *   Based on the `98742.` -> `9874.2` example, if a dot is present, it *must* be used and should not be trailing. To maximize value while respecting this, place the dot just before the last digit in the descending sequence.
            *   Append all digits *except the last one* to `resultParts`.
            *   Append `.` to `resultParts`.
            *   Append the *last* digit to `resultParts`.
        *   **If `hasDot` is false:**
            *   Simply append all digits (which are already in descending order) to `resultParts`. This forms the largest possible integer.

4.  **Final Cleanup (Join and Format):**
    *   Join `resultParts` into a `finalNum` string.
    *   **Remove trailing zeros and dot from fractional part:**
        *   If `finalNum` contains `.`:
            *   Split into `integerPart` and `fractionalPart`.
            *   Remove all trailing '0's from `fractionalPart`.
            *   If `fractionalPart` becomes empty, it means the decimal part was all zeros (e.g., `12.00`). In this case, set `finalNum` to `integerPart` (removing the dot). Otherwise, rejoin with the dot.
    *   **Remove leading zeros:**
        *   Use a regular expression `(/^(-)?0+(?=\d)/, '$1')` to remove leading zeros. This regex handles both positive (`0123` -> `123`) and negative (`-0123` -> `-123`) numbers. It specifically does *not* remove the zero in `0` or `0.something`.
        *   Handle edge cases where `finalNum` might become empty or just `"-"` after cleanup (e.g., from `0` or `-0.0` etc.); set it to `"0"`.

5.  **Print `finalNum`**.

This robust approach addresses the nuances of "using all characters" vs. "greatest number" and the specific formatting rules for dots and zeros.
