The problem asks us to find the maximum amount of food a duck can eat while moving from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid. The duck can only move right or down. This is a classic dynamic programming problem.

**Reasoning:**

Let `dp[r][c]` be the maximum amount of food the duck can collect to reach the cell at row `r` and column `c`. The duck can only move right or down. This means to reach cell `(r, c)`, the duck must have come either from the cell directly above it (`(r-1, c)`) or the cell directly to its left (`(r, c-1)`).

Therefore, the recurrence relation for `dp[r][c]` is:
`dp[r][c] = food[r][c] + max(dp[r-1][c], dp[r][c-1])`

We need to define base cases for the first row and first column:

1.  **Starting Point (0, 0):** `dp[0][0] = food[0][0]` (The duck starts here and collects the food).
2.  **First Row (r=0, c>0):** To reach any cell `(0, c)` in the first row, the duck can only come from `(0, c-1)` (by moving right).
    `dp[0][c] = food[0][c] + dp[0][c-1]`
3.  **First Column (r>0, c=0):** To reach any cell `(r, 0)` in the first column, the duck can only come from `(r-1, 0)` (by moving down).
    `dp[r][0] = food[r][0] + dp[r-1][0]`

The algorithm involves:
1.  Reading the dimensions `W` (width) and `H` (height).
2.  Reading the `H` lines of `W` integers to populate the `food` grid.
3.  Initializing a `dp` table of the same dimensions.
4.  Filling the `dp` table using the base cases and the recurrence relation.
5.  The final answer will be `dp[H-1][W-1]`, representing the maximum food collected at the bottom-right corner.

**Constraints Analysis:**
The constraints `0 < W, H <= 10` mean the grid is very small (at most 10x10). A dynamic programming approach will have a time complexity of O(W*H), which is perfectly fine for these constraints (at most 100 operations), ensuring no timeout. The food amounts are positive and relatively small (`< 256`), so the total sum will easily fit into standard integer types.

**Example Walkthrough (3x3 grid from problem):**

Input Grid (`food`):
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

Initialize `dp` table with zeros:
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

1.  **`dp[0][0] = food[0][0] = 1`**
    ```
    1 0 0
    0 0 0
    0 0 0
    ```

2.  **Fill first row (`r=0`):**
    *   `dp[0][1] = food[0][1] + dp[0][0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
    *   `dp[0][2] = food[0][2] + dp[0][1] = 3 + 3 = 6`
    `dp` table after first row:
    ```
    1 3 6
    0 0 0
    0 0 0
    ```

3.  **Fill first column (`c=0`):**
    *   `dp[1][0] = food[1][0] + dp[0][0] = 4 + 1 = 5`
    *   `dp[2][0] = food[2][0] + dp[1][0] = 7 + 5 = 12`
    `dp` table after first column:
    ```
    1  3  6
    5  0  0
    12 0  0
    ```

4.  **Fill remaining cells (main loops):**
    *   `dp[1][1] = food[1][1] + Math.max(dp[0][1], dp[1][0]) = 5 + Math.max(3, 5) = 5 + 5 = 10`
    *   `dp[1][2] = food[1][2] + Math.max(dp[0][2], dp[1][1]) = 6 + Math.max(6, 10) = 6 + 10 = 16`
    *   `dp[2][1] = food[2][1] + Math.max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0]) = 8 + Math.max(10, 12) = 8 + 12 = 20`
    *   `dp[2][2] = food[2][2] + Math.max(dp[1][2], dp[2][1]) = 9 + Math.max(16, 20) = 9 + 20 = 29`

Final `dp` table:
```
1  3  6
5 10 16
12 20 29
```

The maximum food is `dp[2][2] = 29`, which matches the example output.
