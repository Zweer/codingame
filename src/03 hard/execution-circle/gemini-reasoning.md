The problem describes a variation of the classic Josephus Problem. We have `N` people in a circle, numbered 1 to `N`. Counting starts at a given point `S` and proceeds in a specified direction (`D`). The person *next* to the counting start is executed. The procedure repeats, starting from the person *after* the one who just executed, until only one person remains.

Let's analyze the execution pattern from the example (`N=8, S=5, D=LEFT`):
1.  **Killer**: 5. **Victim**: 6 (next in LEFT/clockwise direction).
    Remaining: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8`.
    Next start: 7 (person after 6 in the original circle, now next to 5).
2.  **Killer**: 7. **Victim**: 8 (next in LEFT/clockwise direction).
    Remaining: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7`.
    Next start: 1 (person after 8 in the original circle, now next to 7).
3.  **Killer**: 1. **Victim**: 2. Next start: 3.
4.  **Killer**: 3. **Victim**: 4. Next start: 5.
5.  **Killer**: 5. **Victim**: 7. Next start: 1.
6.  **Killer**: 1. **Victim**: 3. Next start: 5.
7.  **Killer**: 5. **Victim**: 1. Next start: 5.
Survivor: 5.

This pattern is crucial: if person `P` kills person `V`, the next killer is the person who was originally `V + direction` (in the original circle). This means the killer "jumps" by two positions (relative to the original circle) in each step. For instance, if `P` kills `P+1`, the next killer is `P+2`. If `P` kills `P-1`, the next killer is `P-2`.

This specific variant (where the current killer is effectively skipped, and the person `2*k` steps away is the next killer after `k` steps) maps to a well-known Josephus Problem solution:
For `N` people, 0-indexed `0, ..., N-1`, starting at `0`, and eliminating every second person (`k=2` in general Josephus terminology, meaning "skip 1, kill 1"), the survivor's 0-indexed position is `2 * (N - 2^floor(log2(N)))`.

Let's break down the solution using this formula:

1.  **Core Josephus Calculation (Standardized Scenario):**
    Assume `N` people are arranged `0, 1, ..., N-1`. The killing starts effectively from `0`, and the direction is `+1` (clockwise). Person `0` kills `1`, then person `2` kills `3`, and so on.
    *   Find the largest power of 2, `M`, that is less than or equal to `N`. This is `M = 2 ** Math.floor(Math.log2(N))`.
    *   Calculate `L = N - M`. This `L` represents the count of people remaining after the largest power-of-2 group has been completely eliminated in earlier rounds.
    *   The 0-indexed survivor position in this standardized scenario is `relativeSurvivor0Idx = 2 * L`.

2.  **Adjusting for Starting Point `S` and Direction `D`:**
    The `relativeSurvivor0Idx` is the position of the survivor if the initial *first* person in the circle (position 1) was the logical starting point for the Josephus process, and the direction was `LEFT` (clockwise). We need to transform this result based on `S` and `D`.

    *   **Handling Direction `D`:**
        *   If `D` is `LEFT` (clockwise), the numbering of people (1, 2, ..., N) directly matches the standard Josephus setup's progression.
        *   If `D` is `RIGHT` (counter-clockwise), it's equivalent to reversing the circle. A person at position `P` in the original circle is at position `N - P + 1` in the reversed circle. We can apply this transformation to `S` before using it in the formula, and then reverse the final result back.

    *   **Handling Starting Point `S`:**
        The `relativeSurvivor0Idx` is an offset from a conceptual starting point `0`. In the actual circle, `S` is the starting point.
        So, the 0-indexed survivor position in the actual circle (before final `+1` for 1-indexing) is `(relativeSurvivor0Idx + (adjustedS - 1)) % N`. `adjustedS` refers to `S` if `D=LEFT`, or `N-S+1` if `D=RIGHT`.

3.  **Step-by-step calculation:**
    *   Read `N` and `S` (as numbers, since `10^13` fits within JavaScript's `Number` type which supports up to `2^53` exactly).
    *   Read `D`.
    *   Calculate `powerOf2LessThanOrEqualN = 2 ** Math.floor(Math.log2(N))`.
    *   Calculate `L = N - powerOf2LessThanOrEqualN`.
    *   Calculate `relativeSurvivor0Idx = 2 * L`.

    *   Initialize `currentSAdjustedForDirection` and `finalSurvivor1Idx`.
    *   If `D === 'LEFT'`:
        *   `currentSAdjustedForDirection = S`.
        *   `finalSurvivor1Idx = ((relativeSurvivor0Idx + (currentSAdjustedForDirection - 1)) % N) + 1`.
    *   If `D === 'RIGHT'`:
        *   `currentSAdjustedForDirection = N - S + 1` (map `S` to its equivalent in the reversed circle).
        *   Calculate the survivor in this *reversed* circle (1-indexed):
            `survivorInReversedCircle1Idx = ((relativeSurvivor0Idx + (currentSAdjustedForDirection - 1)) % N) + 1`.
        *   Map this survivor back to the original circle:
            `finalSurvivor1Idx = N - survivorInReversedCircle1Idx + 1`.

    *   Print `finalSurvivor1Idx`.

This approach processes `N` in logarithmic time due to `Math.log2`, making it efficient enough for large `N`.
