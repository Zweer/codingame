The puzzle asks us to simulate a paper folding process followed by a corner cut, and then determine the number of distinct "holes" created when the paper is unfolded. The key challenge lies in correctly tracking the coordinates of the cut point on the original paper and distinguishing between a "hole" (an internal cut) and an "indentation" (a cut along the original paper's edge or a fold line that becomes an edge).

**Understanding the Coordinate System and Folds:**

1.  **Paper Representation:** We can conceptualize the paper as a unit square `[0,1] x [0,1]`.
2.  **Cut Point:** The "corner cut" refers to one of the four corners of the *final, folded* paper. We'll represent these corners by their normalized coordinates:
    *   `tl` (top-left): `(0,0)`
    *   `tr` (top-right): `(1,0)`
    *   `bl` (bottom-left): `(0,1)`
    *   `br` (bottom-right): `(1,1)`
    Crucially, these coordinates `0` or `1` represent positions *on the boundaries* of the currently folded paper.

3.  **Unfolding Transformation (Reverse Simulation):**
    The most effective way to solve this type of problem is to start with the single cut point in the final folded state and "unfold" it back through the reverse sequence of folds. Each unfolding step potentially doubles the number of cut points because the folded paper layer effectively mirrors a portion of the original paper.

    Let `(x_curr, y_curr)` be a coordinate on the paper *after* a specific fold, normalized to `[0,1]x[0,1]`. We want to find the corresponding coordinate `(x_prev, y_prev)` on the paper *before* that fold, also normalized to `[0,1]x[0,1]`.

    *   **R (Right half over Left half):** The right half (`[0.5,1]x[0,1]`) folds over the left half (`[0,0.5]x[0,1]`). The resulting paper occupies the left half `[0,0.5]x[0,1]`, which is then re-scaled to `[0,1]x[0,1]`.
        *   If `(x_curr, y_curr)` came from the original left half (`[0,0.5]x[0,1]`): `x_prev = x_curr / 2`.
        *   If `(x_curr, y_curr)` came from the original right half (`[0.5,1]x[0,1]`): The right half was `[0.5,1]`, folded and mapped to `[0,0.5]`. So, a point `x_prev` in `[0.5,1]` became `(1 - x_prev)` in `[0,0.5]`. After re-scaling to `[0,1]`, `x_curr = 2 * (1 - x_prev)`. Reversing this gives `x_prev = 1 - (x_curr / 2)`.
        *   `y_prev = y_curr` for both cases.
        *   Therefore, an `(x_curr, y_curr)` point in the folded paper maps back to two potential points on the pre-folded paper: `(x_curr / 2, y_curr)` and `(1 - x_curr / 2, y_curr)`.

    *   **L (Left half over Right half):** Similar logic as `R`. The left half (`[0,0.5]x[0,1]`) folds over the right half (`[0.5,1]x[0,1]`). The resulting paper occupies `[0.5,1]x[0,1]`, re-scaled to `[0,1]x[0,1]`.
        *   Points map back to: `(x_curr / 2 + 0.5, y_curr)` and `(1 - x_curr / 2, y_curr)`.

    *   **T (Top half over Bottom half):** Similar logic applied to `y` coordinate. The top half (`[0,1]x[0.5,1]`) folds over `[0,1]x[0,0.5]`. Resulting paper occupies `[0,1]x[0,0.5]`.
        *   Points map back to: `(x_curr, y_curr / 2)` and `(x_curr, 1 - y_curr / 2)`.

    *   **B (Bottom half over Top half):** Similar logic applied to `y` coordinate. The bottom half (`[0,1]x[0,0.5]`) folds over `[0,1]x[0.5,1]`. Resulting paper occupies `[0,1]x[0.5,1]`.
        *   Points map back to: `(x_curr, y_curr / 2 + 0.5)` and `(x_curr, 1 - y_curr / 2)`.

**Identifying Holes vs. Indentations:**

The critical rule is: "Indentations along the paper's edges after unfolding are not considered holes."
This implies that a cut at `(x,y)` on the *original* paper is a hole ONLY if `0 < x < 1` AND `0 < y < 1`.
If `x=0` or `x=1` or `y=0` or `y=1`, the cut is on the original paper's boundary and thus an indentation.
The coordinates `0.0`, `0.5`, `0.25`, `0.75`, etc., are all fractional values of the form `k / 2^m`. If such a value ends up as `0.0` or `1.0` (within floating point tolerance) for either `x` or `y`, it's an indentation. Otherwise, it's a hole.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Separate fold instructions (`folds_str`) from the cut corner (`cut_corner`).
2.  **Initialize `current_cut_points`:** This `Set<string>` will store the `"${x},${y}"` string representation of unique coordinates. Initialize it with the single point corresponding to the `cut_corner` in the *final folded paper's* `[0,1]x[0,1]` coordinate system.
3.  **Unfold Loop:** Iterate through the `folds_str` in *reverse order*. For each fold instruction:
    *   Create a `next_set_of_points` set.
    *   For each `(x,y)` in `current_cut_points`, apply the inverse transformation rules (as derived above) to get two potential `(x_prev, y_prev)` points. Add these two points to `next_set_of_points`.
    *   Update `current_cut_points` to `next_set_of_points`.
4.  **Count Holes:** After all folds are reversed, iterate through the final `current_cut_points`. For each `(x,y)`:
    *   Check if `x` is strictly between `0` and `1` AND `y` is strictly between `0` and `1`. Use a small `boundary_tolerance` (e.g., `1e-9`) to account for floating-point inaccuracies.
    *   If both conditions are met, increment the `hole_count`.
5.  **Output `hole_count`**.

**Example Trace: `R-tr`**
1.  `folds_str = "R"`, `cut_corner = "tr"`.
2.  `current_cut_points` initialized with `(1,0)` (top-right corner).
    `current_cut_points = {"1,0"}`.
3.  Unfold loop: `i = 0`, `fold_char = 'R'`.
    *   Process `(x=1, y=0)`:
        *   Unfold `R` rule: `(x/2, y)` and `(1 - x/2, y)`.
        *   `p1 = (1/2, 0) = (0.5, 0)`.
        *   `p2 = (1 - 1/2, 0) = (0.5, 0)`.
        *   `next_set_of_points = {"0.5,0"}`.
    *   `current_cut_points` becomes `{"0.5,0"}`.
4.  End of loop.
5.  Count holes: Check `(0.5, 0)`.
    *   `x=0.5`: `0 < 0.5 < 1` (true).
    *   `y=0`: `0 < 0 < 1` (false, `y` is on boundary).
    *   Not a hole. `hole_count = 0`. This matches the example.

**Example Trace: `TR-br`**
1.  `folds_str = "TR"`, `cut_corner = "br"`.
2.  `current_cut_points` initialized with `(1,1)` (bottom-right corner).
    `current_cut_points = {"1,1"}`.
3.  Unfold loop (reverse order: `R` then `T`):
    *   `i = 1`, `fold_char = 'R'`.
        *   Process `(x=1, y=1)`:
            *   Unfold `R` rule: `(x/2, y)` and `(1 - x/2, y)`.
            *   `p1 = (1/2, 1) = (0.5, 1)`.
            *   `p2 = (1 - 1/2, 1) = (0.5, 1)`.
            *   `next_set_of_points = {"0.5,1"}`.
        *   `current_cut_points` becomes `{"0.5,1"}`.
    *   `i = 0`, `fold_char = 'T'`.
        *   Process `(x=0.5, y=1)`:
            *   Unfold `T` rule: `(x, y/2)` and `(x, 1 - y/2)`.
            *   `p1 = (0.5, 1/2) = (0.5, 0.5)`.
            *   `p2 = (0.5, 1 - 1/2) = (0.5, 0.5)`.
            *   `next_set_of_points = {"0.5,0.5"}`.
        *   `current_cut_points` becomes `{"0.5,0.5"}`.
4.  End of loop.
5.  Count holes: Check `(0.5, 0.5)`.
    *   `x=0.5`: `0 < 0.5 < 1` (true).
    *   `y=0.5`: `0 < 0.5 < 1` (true).
    *   It is a hole. `hole_count = 1`.

This logic correctly handles the special case of `R-tr` and provides a mechanism for holes to be created in other scenarios.
