The problem asks us to simulate the movement of a roller coaster wagon along a track and determine its final stopping position. The track is represented as an ASCII grid, with horizontal tracks (`_`), descending slopes (`\`), and ascending slopes (`/`). Dots (`.`) represent empty space.

Here's a breakdown of the rules and how they are implemented:

1.  **Track Representation:**
    The input provides `W` (width) and `H` (height) of the grid, followed by `H` lines. Since "every ascii column has one and only one track", we can pre-process the grid into a 1D array, `trackChars`, where `trackChars[c]` stores the character (`_`, `\`, or `/`) at column `c`. The vertical position (`y`) of the track element isn't directly needed for the movement logic, only its type and horizontal position (`x`).

2.  **Initial State:**
    The wagon starts at `currentX = 0` (the leftmost track element) with a given `initialInertia`. The `direction` is initially `1` (moving right).

3.  **Simulation Loop (per turn):**
    The simulation runs in a loop until a stopping condition is met. Each iteration represents one turn:

    a.  **Inertia Change:**
        The `currentInertia` is updated based on the `trackChar` at `currentX` and the `direction` of movement.
        *   Horizontal track (`_`): Inertia decreases by 1 (`-1`). This effect is independent of direction.
        *   Descending slope (`\`):
            *   Moving right: It's truly a descent, so inertia increases by 9 (`+9`).
            *   Moving left: It's effectively an ascent (uphill), so inertia decreases by 10 (`-10`).
        *   Ascending slope (`/`):
            *   Moving right: It's truly an ascent, so inertia decreases by 10 (`-10`).
            *   Moving left: It's effectively a descent (downhill), so inertia increases by 9 (`+9`).

    b.  **Direction Change (if inertia goes negative):**
        If `currentInertia` becomes negative after the update, the wagon immediately reverses direction.
        *   `currentInertia` is updated to its absolute value (`Math.abs(currentInertia)`).
        *   `direction` is reversed (`direction *= -1`).

    c.  **Stopping Condition 1: Inertia 0 on Horizontal Track:**
        If, after the inertia update, `currentInertia` is `0` AND the `trackChar` is `_` (horizontal), the wagon stops immediately at its current position `currentX`. (Note: The problem explicitly states that `0` inertia on a slope does *not* stop the wagon).

    d.  **Movement:**
        The wagon attempts to move.
        *   If `currentInertia` is greater than `0`, the wagon moves one step in its `direction` (`nextX = currentX + direction`).
        *   If `currentInertia` is `0`, the wagon stays in place (`nextX = currentX`).

    e.  **Stopping Condition 2: Reaching Track Edges:**
        After determining `nextX`, if this `nextX` would take the wagon off the track:
        *   If `nextX < 0` (moving left off the start), it stops at position `0`.
        *   If `nextX >= W` (moving right off the end), it stops at position `W-1`.
        In these cases, the simulation ends.

    f.  **Update Position:**
        If no stopping condition has been met, `currentX` is updated to `nextX`, and the loop continues for the next turn.

The `while(true)` loop ensures the simulation continues until one of the `return` statements (stopping conditions) is hit. Given the problem constraints (`W`, `H` < 100, `inertia` < 100), the simulation is guaranteed to terminate within reasonable time, as it will eventually hit a boundary or drain inertia to stop on a horizontal track.

### Example Walkthrough (from Problem Description):

**Example 0:** `inertia = 2`, `W=8`, track is `_ _ ... _`
1.  `X=0`, `I=2`, `D=1`
    *   `track = '_'`. `I = 2 - 1 = 1`.
    *   Not 0 on `_`. Move: `nextX = 0 + 1 = 1`. `currentX = 1`.
2.  `X=1`, `I=1`, `D=1`
    *   `track = '_'`. `I = 1 - 1 = 0`.
    *   `I = 0` AND `track = '_'`. **STOP.** Output `1`.

This matches the example.

The provided TypeScript code implements this logic.
