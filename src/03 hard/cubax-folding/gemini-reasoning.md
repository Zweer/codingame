The problem asks us to find all possible sequences of moves (directions) to fold a chain of small cubes (`Cubax`) into an `N x N x N` cube. The Cubax starts with its first element at `(1,1,1)` and must end with its last element at `(N,N,N)`. The structure of Cubax is given as a string `BLOCKS`, where each character represents the length of a straight segment of cubes. Turns between segments must be at a right angle (90 degrees), and no U-turns are allowed. The first segment cannot start with `D`, `L`, or `B` directions.

This problem can be solved using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or backtracking algorithm.

**Algorithm Breakdown:**

1.  **State Representation:**
    *   `currentPos`: An array `[x, y, z]` representing the coordinates of the current head of the Cubax (the start of the segment we are currently trying to place).
    *   `segmentDir`: An array `[dx, dy, dz]` representing the direction vector of the segment we are currently placing.
    *   `segmentIndex`: The index of the current segment in the `BLOCKS` array.
    *   `path`: The string of direction characters accumulated so far for the segments already placed.
    *   `VISITED_GRID_GLOBAL`: A 3D boolean array `N x N x N` to keep track of visited cells. This prevents self-intersections of the Cubax. Coordinates `(x,y,z)` map to `[x-1][y-1][z-1]` in the 0-indexed grid.

2.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   Read `N` and `BLOCKS`.
    *   Initialize `TARGET_POS_GLOBAL` as `[N, N, N]`.
    *   Initialize `SOLUTIONS_GLOBAL` as an empty array to store valid paths.
    *   Initialize `VISITED_GRID_GLOBAL` with all cells `false`.
    *   Mark the starting position `(1,1,1)` as `true` in `VISITED_GRID_GLOBAL`.

3.  **DFS Function (`solve`):**
    *   **Place the Current Segment:**
        *   Get `segmentLength` from `BLOCKS_GLOBAL[segmentIndex]`.
        *   Starting from `currentPos`, iterate `segmentLength - 1` times (as the first block is already `currentPos`).
        *   In each iteration, calculate the `nextBlockPos` by adding `segmentDir` to the `lastBlockPos`.
        *   **Check Validity:** Before marking `nextBlockPos` as visited:
            *   Ensure `nextBlockPos` is within the `N x N x N` cube bounds (`1` to `N` for each coordinate).
            *   Ensure `nextBlockPos` has not been visited before (i.e., `isCellVisited(nextBlockPos)` is `false`).
            *   If any check fails, this path is invalid. Immediately unmark any cells marked *in this loop for this segment* and return.
        *   If valid, mark `nextBlockPos` as `true` and add it to a temporary list (`pathPointsMarkedByThisSegment`) for backtracking. Update `lastBlockPos` to `nextBlockPos`.

    *   **Base Case (All Segments Placed):**
        *   If `segmentIndex` is the last index of `BLOCKS_GLOBAL` (i.e., `BLOCKS_GLOBAL.length - 1`):
            *   Check if `lastBlockPos` (the end of the entire Cubax) matches `TARGET_POS_GLOBAL`.
            *   If they match, a valid solution is found. Add the `path` string to `SOLUTIONS_GLOBAL`.
            *   Unmark all cells that were marked by `this` segment (using `pathPointsMarkedByThisSegment`).
            *   Return.

    *   **Recursive Step (Place Next Segment):**
        *   If not the last segment, iterate through all possible `DIRECTION_CHARS` for the `nextDirChar`.
        *   For each `nextDirVector` corresponding to `nextDirChar`:
            *   **Check Turn Constraints:**
                *   The `nextDirVector` must be orthogonal to `segmentDir` (dot product is 0).
                *   The `nextDirVector` must not be opposite to `segmentDir` (no U-turns).
                *   If constraints are not met, skip this `nextDirChar`.
            *   Recursively call `solve` with:
                *   `lastBlockPos` (the start of the next segment).
                *   `nextDirVector`.
                *   `segmentIndex + 1`.
                *   `path + nextDirChar` (append the direction for the current segment).

    *   **Backtrack:**
        *   After all recursive calls for the current `segmentIndex` return, unmark all cells that were marked by `this` segment (using `pathPointsMarkedByThisSegment`). This allows other branches of the DFS to use these cells.

4.  **Initiating DFS:**
    *   The problem states the first element is at `(1,1,1)` and "no valid solution starting by D, L or B".
    *   Therefore, start the DFS by calling `solve` for the first segment (`segmentIndex = 0`) with `currentPos = [1,1,1]` and initial directions `R`, `U`, and `F`.

5.  **Output:**
    *   After the DFS completes, sort `SOLUTIONS_GLOBAL` alphabetically.
    *   Print each solution on a new line.

**Example Trace (N=2, BLOCKS="2222222", target=(2,2,2))**:

1.  Initial: `solve([1,1,1], [1,0,0], 0, "R")` (trying 'R' as first direction)
2.  `solve([1,1,1], [1,0,0], 0, "R")`:
    *   `segmentLength = 2`. Places `[2,1,1]`. `pathPointsMarkedByThisSegment = [[2,1,1]]`. `lastBlockPos = [2,1,1]`.
    *   Not last segment. Recursively call `solve` for `segmentIndex = 1`.
    *   Try `nextDirChar = 'F'` (orthogonal to 'R'): `solve([2,1,1], [0,0,1], 1, "RF")`
3.  `solve([2,1,1], [0,0,1], 1, "RF")`:
    *   `segmentLength = 2`. Places `[2,1,2]`. `pathPointsMarkedByThisSegment = [[2,1,2]]`. `lastBlockPos = [2,1,2]`.
    *   Not last segment. Recursively call `solve` for `segmentIndex = 2`.
    *   Try `nextDirChar = 'L'` (orthogonal to 'F'): `solve([2,1,2], [-1,0,0], 2, "RFL")`
    *   ... (and so on, until all 7 segments are placed and the end position is `[2,2,2]`)
    *   If a solution `RFLUBRF` is found, it's added to `SOLUTIONS_GLOBAL`.
    *   Then, backtracking occurs: `[2,2,2]` is unmarked, `[2,2,1]` is unmarked, `[1,2,1]` is unmarked, etc., as the DFS explores other branches.

This recursive approach with backtracking systematically explores all possible valid paths, ensuring no collisions and adhering to all given constraints.
