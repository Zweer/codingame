Einstein's riddle is a classic logic puzzle that can be solved using constraint satisfaction. The goal is to deduce the unique set of characteristics for each person based on a series of positive and negative relational links.

### Problem Analysis

1.  **Entities and Categories:** We have `nbPeople` individuals, and `nbCharacteristics` categories of attributes (e.g., names, transportation, plants, pets). Each person has exactly one characteristic from each category, and all characteristics within a category are unique across the `nbPeople` individuals.
2.  **Relational Links:** Links are provided as `A & B` (A is linked to B) or `A ! B` (A is not linked to B). These links can be between any two characteristics, regardless of their category, as long as they are not in the same category.
3.  **Deduction:** The problem guarantees that the links are sufficient and non-contradictory. This means a unique solution exists and can be found through logical deduction.
4.  **Output Format:** The solution must be presented as a grid. The first row (category) of characteristics defines the column order (alphabetically sorted). Subsequent rows are filled to match the characteristic for the person in that column.

### Data Structures

To solve this, we need to track the possible relationships between all pairs of characteristics.

1.  **`allCharacteristicsByCategory: string[][]`**: Stores the lists of characteristics for each category, maintaining the input order of categories. `allCharacteristicsByCategory[i]` is an array of strings for category `i`.
2.  **`charToCategoryIndex: Map<string, number>`**: A quick lookup table to find the category index for any given characteristic name.
3.  **`allCharacteristicNames: string[]`**: A flattened list of all unique characteristic names, useful for iterating through all possible pairs.
4.  **`possiblePairs: Map<string, Map<string, boolean>>`**: This is the core data structure. `possiblePairs.get(char1)!.get(char2)` will be:
    *   `true`: If `char1` and `char2` *can* be linked.
    *   `false`: If `char1` and `char2` *cannot* be linked.
    Initially, characteristics from different categories can be linked (`true`), while characteristics from the same category cannot (`false`).

### Algorithm

The solution employs an iterative deduction process:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Read `nbCharacteristics` and `nbPeople`.
    *   Populate `allCharacteristicsByCategory`, `charToCategoryIndex`, and `allCharacteristicNames`.
    *   Initialize `possiblePairs`:
        *   For any two characteristics `c1` and `c2`:
            *   If `c1` and `c2` belong to the same category, set `possiblePairs[c1][c2]` and `possiblePairs[c2][c1]` to `false`.
            *   If `c1` and `c2` belong to different categories, set `possiblePairs[c1][c2]` and `possiblePairs[c2][c1]` to `true`.
        *   A helper function `setLinkStatus(char1, char2, status)` is used to update `possiblePairs` symmetrically and return `true` if a change occurred.

2.  **Process Initial Links:**
    *   Read `N` relational links.
    *   For each link `A & B`, call `setLinkStatus(A, B, true)`.
    *   For each link `A ! B`, call `setLinkStatus(A, B, false)`.

3.  **Deduction Loop:**
    This loop continues as long as new deductions are made.
    *   **Phase 1 (Propagation of True Links):**
        *   Iterate through all pairs of characteristics `(c1, c2)`.
        *   If `possiblePairs.get(c1)!.get(c2)` is `true` (meaning `c1` and `c2` are definitively linked):
            *   Because each person has only one characteristic from each category, and each characteristic belongs to only one person:
                *   `c1` cannot be linked to any *other* characteristic `c2_other` in `c2`'s category. Set `possiblePairs[c1][c2_other]` to `false`.
                *   `c2` cannot be linked to any *other* characteristic `c1_other` in `c1`'s category. Set `possiblePairs[c2][c1_other]` to `false`.
            *   Any change made in this phase sets a `anyChangeOverall` flag to `true`.
    *   **Phase 2 (Deduction from Elimination):**
        *   Iterate through all characteristics `c1`.
        *   For each category `catBIndex` different from `c1`'s category:
            *   Count how many characteristics `c2` in `catBIndex` can still be linked to `c1` (i.e., `possiblePairs.get(c1)!.get(c2)` is `true`).
            *   If only *one* `c2` remains as a possibility, then `c1` *must* be linked to that `c2`. Set `possiblePairs[c1][c2]` to `true`.
            *   Any change made in this phase sets a `anyChangeOverall` flag to `true`.

    *   The loop repeats as long as `anyChangeOverall` is `true` after both phases, ensuring all possible deductions are made.

4.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Create an empty `outputGrid` with dimensions `nbCharacteristics` x `nbPeople`.
    *   The first row of the output is `allCharacteristicsByCategory[0]` (the first input category) sorted alphabetically. This defines the column order for the grid.
    *   For each person (column `j`):
        *   Get the person's defining characteristic from the first row (`personChar = outputGrid[0][j]`).
        *   For each subsequent category (`i` from 1 to `nbCharacteristics - 1`):
            *   Iterate through characteristics `charK` in `allCharacteristicsByCategory[i]`.
            *   The one `charK` for which `possiblePairs.get(personChar)!.get(charK)` is `true` is the characteristic for `personChar` in category `i`. Assign it to `outputGrid[i][j]`.

5.  **Print Output:**
    *   Print each row of `outputGrid`, with elements joined by spaces.

The constraints (`nbCharacteristics`, `nbPeople` < 10) ensure that this iterative approach, even with nested loops, is efficient enough to solve the puzzle within typical time limits.
