The problem asks us to find all winning moves for a player in a game of Misère Nim. In Misère Nim, the player who takes the last object loses.

**Understanding Misère Nim Strategy**

Misère Nim differs from Normal Nim (where the last player to move wins) primarily in the endgame. The general strategy is summarized as follows:

A position in Misère Nim is a **P-position** (previous player wins, meaning the current player loses) if and only if:
1.  All heaps are of size 1, AND there is an even number of heaps (`N` is even).
2.  At least one heap is of size greater than 1, AND the Nim-sum (XOR sum of all heap sizes) is 0.

A position is an **N-position** (next player wins, meaning the current player wins) if and only if:
1.  All heaps are of size 1, AND there is an odd number of heaps (`N` is odd).
2.  At least one heap is of size greater than 1, AND the Nim-sum is non-zero.

**Finding Winning Moves**

If the current position is a P-position, the player must `CONCEDE`.
If the current position is an N-position, the player must find moves that transform the current state into a P-position for the opponent.

**Special Case: N = 1**
The behavior for `N=1` (only one heap) is a common point of confusion in Misère Nim and often behaves differently from the general rules above. Let's analyze based on the provided example (`[5]`, `[1]`, `[7]` for `N=1`):

*   **Heap `[1]`**: The example output is `CONCEDE`. This implies that `[1]` is a P-position. If you face `[1]`, you must take the 1 object, thus taking the last object and losing.
*   **Heap `[M]` where `M > 1` (e.g., `[5]`, `[7]`)**: The example output is `1:4` for `[5]` (leaving `[1]`) and `1:6` for `[7]` (leaving `[1]`). This implies that `[M]` (`M>1`) is an N-position, and the winning strategy is to take `M-1` objects, leaving the opponent with `[1]`. Since `[1]` is a P-position for the opponent, this is a winning move.

This indicates that for `N=1`, the logic is simpler: you lose if the heap is `[1]`, and you win if the heap is `[M > 1]` by leaving `[1]`.

**General Case: N > 1**
For `N > 1`, we apply the standard Misère Nim strategy:

1.  **Determine P/N status:**
    *   Calculate `xorSum` (Nim-sum).
    *   Count `numOnes` (heaps of size 1).
    *   Check `allHeapsAreOnes = (numOnes === N)`.
    *   Apply the P/N rules listed above.

2.  **If N-position, find winning moves:**
    *   **If `allHeapsAreOnes` (and `N` is odd, `xorSum != 0`)**: Any move is to take 1 object from any heap. This leaves `N-1` heaps of size 1. Since `N` is odd, `N-1` is even. The resulting state (`N-1` heaps of 1s) is a P-position for the opponent. So, all moves `(i+1, 1)` are winning moves.
    *   **If `!allHeapsAreOnes` (and `xorSum != 0`)**: The strategy is the same as finding winning moves in Normal Nim. For each heap `Mi`, we look for a move that changes `Mi` to `Mi'` such that `Mi' XOR (xorSum XOR Mi) = 0`. This simplifies to `Mi' = xorSum XOR Mi`. Let `targetSize = xorSum XOR Mi`. If `targetSize < Mi`, then taking `Mi - targetSize` objects from heap `Mi` is a winning move. This results in a state where the Nim-sum is 0, placing the opponent in a P-position (either all 1s and even count, or not all 1s and xorSum 0).

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  Read `N` and `K`.
2.  For each of the `K` game positions:
    a.  Read the heap sizes `M1, ..., MN`.
    b.  Calculate `xorSum` and `numOnes`. Determine `allHeapsAreOnes`.
    c.  Determine if the current position is a winning (N) or losing (P) position based on the logic described above (special handling for `N=1`).
    d.  If losing, print "CONCEDE".
    e.  If winning, find all possible winning moves `(i:a)`:
        *   If `N=1`: The only winning move is `(1, M1-1)`.
        *   If `N > 1` and `allHeapsAreOnes`: All moves `(i+1, 1)` for each heap `i`.
        *   If `N > 1` and `!allHeapsAreOnes`: For each heap `i` with size `Mi`, if `(Mi XOR xorSum) < Mi`, then `(i+1, Mi - (Mi XOR xorSum))` is a winning move.
    f.  Sort the winning moves by heap number (`i`) then by amount (`a`).
    g.  Print the sorted moves in the specified format `i:a`.
