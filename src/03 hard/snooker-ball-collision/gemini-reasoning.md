The problem asks us to predict the final resting positions of two snooker balls after a potential collision, considering friction. One ball is initially moving, and the other is static.

Here's a breakdown of the solution approach:

1.  **Physics of a Single Ball Stopping:**
    The friction model is given by `a_d(t) = -0.8 * v(t)`. This is a first-order linear differential equation `dv/dt = -0.8 * v`.
    The solution for velocity is `v(t) = v0 * exp(-0.8 * t)`, where `v0` is the initial velocity.
    To find the position `x(t)`, we integrate `v(t)`:
    `x(t) = x0 + ∫(v0 * exp(-0.8 * τ) dτ from 0 to t)`
    `x(t) = x0 + v0 / 0.8 * (1 - exp(-0.8 * t))`
    As `t` approaches infinity, `exp(-0.8 * t)` approaches `0`. Therefore, the total distance a ball travels before stopping completely (if unimpeded) is `d = v0 / 0.8`.
    The final position (x-component) would be `x_f = x0 + vx0 / 0.8`. The same applies to the y-component.
    Let `K = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`. So, `P_final = P_initial + V_initial * K`. This holds for any ball that stops solely due to friction.

2.  **Collision Detection:**
    A collision occurs when the distance between the centers of the two balls is `2 * R`, where `R` is the ball radius (30.75mm = 0.03075m).
    The moving ball (Ball 0) travels along a straight line in the direction of its initial velocity, starting from `P0_start` and theoretically stopping at `P0_final_no_collision = P0_start + V0_start * K`.
    The static ball (Ball 1) remains at `P1_start` until a collision.
    We need to determine if this line segment (Ball 0's path) intersects a circle of radius `2R` centered at `P1_start`. This is a standard line-segment-circle intersection problem.
    We find the parameter `t_coll_parameter` (from 0 to 1) along the segment where the collision occurs. `t_coll_parameter = distance_to_collision / total_distance_if_no_collision`.

    There are two main scenarios for collision:
    *   **Immediate Collision (at t=0):** If the balls are already overlapping or touching (`|P0_start - P1_start| <= 2R`) when the simulation begins, the collision happens at `t=0`.
    *   **Collision along path:** If not initially overlapping, we check if the path segment of the moving ball intersects the collision circle around the static ball. The intersection point closest to `P0_start` and within the segment `[0,1]` is chosen.

3.  **Time of Collision (`t_c`):**
    Once `t_coll_parameter` is found, we can determine the actual time `t_c` in seconds when the collision occurs.
    From `t_coll_parameter = 1 - exp(-0.8 * t_c)`, we solve for `t_c`:
    `exp(-0.8 * t_c) = 1 - t_coll_parameter`
    `t_c = -1 / 0.8 * log(1 - t_coll_parameter)`
    Special cases: if `t_coll_parameter` is 0, then `t_c = 0`. If `t_coll_parameter` is 1 (meaning collision occurs exactly as the ball would stop), `t_c` approaches infinity, implying the velocity of the moving ball just before collision is effectively zero.

4.  **Elastic Collision Physics (Equal Masses):**
    Snooker balls have equal mass. For a perfectly elastic collision between two equal-mass balls, where one ball (Ball 0) has a pre-collision velocity `V0_pre` and the other (Ball 1) is static (`V1_pre = 0`):
    *   The velocities along the line of centers (normal direction `N`) are exchanged.
    *   The velocities perpendicular to the line of centers (tangential direction) are unchanged.
    Let `N` be the unit vector from `P1` to `P0` at the moment of collision.
    `V0_pre_normal = dot(V0_pre, N) * N`
    `V0_pre_tangential = V0_pre - V0_pre_normal`
    After collision:
    `V0_post = V0_pre_tangential` (Ball 0 continues with its tangential velocity)
    `V1_post = V0_pre_normal` (Ball 1 moves off with Ball 0's normal velocity)
    A special case is when the balls' centers are coincident at collision (e.g., if input allows `P0_start == P1_start`). In this case, `N` is undefined. The rule for identical, perfectly overlapping balls is that the moving ball transfers all momentum and stops, while the static ball moves off with the initial velocity. So, `V0_post = 0` and `V1_post = V0_pre`.

5.  **Final Positions After Collision:**
    After the collision, both balls have new initial velocities (`V0_post`, `V1_post`) from their collision positions (`P0_at_coll`, `P1_at_coll`). They then continue to slow down due to friction, traveling a further distance `V_post / 0.8`.
    `P0_final = P0_at_coll + V0_post * K`
    `P1_final = P1_at_coll + V1_post * K`

6.  **Edge Cases and Precision:**
    *   If the initial velocity is `(0, 0)`, no movement occurs, and positions remain unchanged.
    *   Floating-point comparisons require an `EPSILON` (e.g., `1e-9`) to account for precision issues.
    *   Results must be rounded to two decimal places using `toFixed(2)`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  Read input for `P0_start`, `P1_start`, `V0_start`.
2.  Initialize `P0_final` and `P1_final`.
3.  If `magnitude(V0_start)` is effectively zero (less than `EPSILON`), set `P0_final = P0_start` and `P1_final = P1_start`, then print and exit.
4.  Calculate `P0_final_no_collision` (where Ball 0 would stop without collision) and `total_dist_if_no_collision`.
5.  Determine `t_coll_parameter` and `actual_time_of_collision`:
    *   First, check for initial overlap: if `|P0_start - P1_start|^2 <= (2R)^2 + EPSILON`, set `t_coll_parameter = 0` and `actual_time_of_collision = 0`.
    *   Otherwise, perform line-segment-circle intersection test using `P0_start`, `P0_final_no_collision`, `P1_start`, and `2R`. Find the smallest `t_coll_parameter` (between 0 and 1) that indicates an intersection.
    *   If a `t_coll_parameter` is found:
        *   Clamp it to `[0, 1]` to handle floating point errors.
        *   Calculate `actual_time_of_collision` using the exponential decay formula. Handle `t_coll_parameter` close to 1 separately as `Infinity` to signify zero velocity before impact.
6.  If a collision was detected (`t_coll_parameter !== -1`):
    *   Calculate `P0_at_coll` (Ball 0's position at collision). `P1_at_coll` is `P1_start`.
    *   Calculate `V0_pre_collision` (Ball 0's velocity just before collision) using `V0_start * exp(-0.8 * actual_time_of_collision)`.
    *   Calculate `V0_post` and `V1_post` (velocities after collision) using the elastic collision formulas. Handle the case where centers are coincident at collision.
    *   Calculate `P0_final` and `P1_final` by adding `V_post * K` to their respective collision positions.
7.  Else (no collision detected):
    *   `P0_final = P0_final_no_collision`.
    *   `P1_final = P1_start`.
8.  Print `P0_final.x`, `P0_final.y`, `P1_final.x`, `P1_final.y` rounded to two decimal places.
