The puzzle asks us to simulate the classic Tower of Hanoi game using a specific iterative algorithm and then display the game state at a given turn `T`, along with the total number of steps required to complete the game.

### Algorithm Description

The given algorithm has two types of moves per "turn cycle":
1.  **Smallest Disk Move**:
    *   If `N` (number of disks) is **even**: the smallest disk (disk 1) moves one axis to the **right**. Assuming pegs are 0 (left), 1 (middle), 2 (right), this means `P -> (P + 1) % 3`.
    *   If `N` (number of disks) is **odd**: the smallest disk (disk 1) moves one axis to the **left**. This means `P -> (P - 1 + 3) % 3`.
2.  **Other Disk Move**: After the smallest disk moves, perform the single other possible move that does *not* involve the smallest disk. This means considering the two pegs that do not currently hold the smallest disk. The valid move will be to take the smaller top disk from one of these two pegs and place it on the other peg (either on an empty peg or on a larger disk).

This two-part move constitutes one "turn" in the context of `turnCount`.

### Game State Representation

*   We'll use an array of arrays `pegs: number[][]` to represent the three pegs. `pegs[0]`, `pegs[1]`, `pegs[2]` correspond to the left, middle, and right axes.
*   Each inner array (peg) stores the disks on it, with the largest disk at the beginning of the array (bottom of the stack) and the smallest disk at the end (top of the stack). This allows easy `pop()` and `push()` operations for moving disks.
*   Disks are identified by their size, from `1` (smallest) to `N` (largest).

### Simulation Steps

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   Read `N` and `T`.
    *   Initialize `pegs[0]` with disks `N, N-1, ..., 1` in that order (bottom to top). `pegs[1]` and `pegs[2]` are empty.
    *   Initialize `smallestDiskCurrentPeg = 0` (as disk 1 starts on peg 0).
    *   Initialize `turnCount = 0`.
    *   Initialize `stateAtT = null` to store the required game state.

2.  **Simulation Loop**:
    *   The loop continues as long as `pegs[2].length !== N` (i.e., not all disks are on the rightmost peg).
    *   **Inside each iteration (representing one full "turn cycle"):**
        *   **Smallest Disk Move**:
            *   Determine the `targetPeg` for disk 1 based on `N`'s parity and `smallestDiskCurrentPeg`.
            *   Move disk 1 using `makeMove(smallestDiskCurrentPeg, targetPeg)`. This function also updates `smallestDiskCurrentPeg`.
            *   Increment `turnCount`.
            *   If `turnCount` equals `T`, deep copy the current `pegs` state into `stateAtT`.
            *   Check if the game is finished. If so, `break` the loop.
        *   **Other Disk Move**:
            *   Identify the two pegs that do *not* contain the smallest disk (i.e., the pegs other than `smallestDiskCurrentPeg`).
            *   Compare the top disks of these two pegs. Move the smaller disk from its peg to the other peg (or to an empty peg if one is empty).
            *   Increment `turnCount`.
            *   If `turnCount` equals `T`, deep copy the current `pegs` state into `stateAtT`.
            *   Check if the game is finished. If so, `break` the loop.

3.  **Output**:
    *   **Game State**: Once the simulation is complete or `turnCount` reaches `T`, print `stateAtT`.
        *   Calculate `maxDiskWidth = 2 * N + 1`.
        *   Iterate `N` times for rows (from top to bottom).
        *   For each row, iterate through the three pegs.
        *   Determine if there's a disk at the current height `(N - 1 - currentRowIndex)`.
        *   If there's a disk, calculate its width `(2 * diskSize + 1)` and the required `padding` (spaces on each side) to center it within `maxDiskWidth`. Print padding, hashes, padding.
        *   If no disk, print the pole character `'|'` centered within `maxDiskWidth`.
        *   Add a single space between peg outputs.
        *   Use `.trimEnd()` to remove trailing spaces from each line.
    *   **Total Moves**: The total moves for N disks in Hanoi Tower is `2^N - 1`. Print this value.

### Example Trace (N=3, T=6)

As detailed in the thought process, following the corrected rules:
*   `N=3` (odd) means smallest disk moves `P -> (P - 1 + 3) % 3` (left).
*   Initial state: `P0: [3, 2, 1]`, `P1: []`, `P2: []`. `smallestDiskCurrentPeg = 0`.

| Turn | Move 1 (Smallest Disk)                           | Pegs after Move 1      | smallestDiskCurrentPeg | Move 2 (Other Disk)                           | Pegs after Move 2      |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 1    | Disk 1: `P0` -> `P2` (0 -> (0-1+3)%3 = 2)      | `P0: [3, 2]`, `P1: []`, `P2: [1]` | 2                      | Disk 2: `P0` -> `P1` (`P0` top 2, `P1` empty) | `P0: [3]`, `P1: [2]`, `P2: [1]` |
| 2    | Disk 1: `P2` -> `P1` (2 -> (2-1+3)%3 = 1)      | `P0: [3]`, `P1: [2, 1]`, `P2: []` | 1                      | Disk 3: `P0` -> `P2` (`P0` top 3, `P2` empty) | `P0: []`, `P1: [2, 1]`, `P2: [3]` |
| 3    | Disk 1: `P1` -> `P0` (1 -> (1-1+3)%3 = 0)      | `P0: [1]`, `P1: [2]`, `P2: [3]` | 0                      | Disk 2: `P1` -> `P2` (`P1` top 2, `P2` top 3) | `P0: [1]`, `P1: []`, `P2: [3, 2]` |

At `turnCount = 6`, the state `P0: [1]`, `P1: []`, `P2: [3, 2]` is captured, which matches the example output.
The total moves calculated as `2^3 - 1 = 7`.
