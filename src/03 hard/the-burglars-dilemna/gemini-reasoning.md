The problem asks us to find a unique safe combination given a series of failed attempts. Each attempt provides a sequence of numbers and corresponding sounds (CLICK, CLACK, CLUCK). We know that each sound corresponds to one of three meanings: "correct number", "adjacent to correct number", or "incorrect and not adjacent". We don't know which sound maps to which meaning, and each sound maps to a unique meaning.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Understand Meanings and Adjacency:**
    *   **Meanings:** `CORRECT`, `ADJACENT`, `INCORRECT`.
    *   **Sounds:** `CLICK`, `CLACK`, `CLUCK`.
    *   **Adjacency:** Digits `x` and `y` are adjacent if `abs(x-y) == 1` or if `(x=0, y=9)` or `(x=9, y=0)`.

2.  **Possible Sound-Meaning Mappings:**
    Since there are 3 sounds and 3 unique meanings, there are 3! = 6 possible permutations of how sounds map to meanings. For example, `CLICK` could be `CORRECT`, `CLACK` could be `ADJACENT`, and `CLUCK` could be `INCORRECT`, or any other permutation. We need to test each of these 6 mappings.

3.  **Validate Each Mapping:**
    For each of the 6 possible sound-to-meaning mappings:
    a.  **Initialize Possibilities:** For each position in the `C`-digit safe combination, maintain a `Set` of `possibleDigits`. Initially, each set contains all digits from 0 to 9.
    b.  **Apply Constraints from Attempts:** Iterate through each of the `N` attempts and each position `j` (from 0 to `C-1`).
        *   Let `attemptDigit` be the number at position `j` in the current attempt.
        *   Let `sound` be the sound at position `j` in the current attempt.
        *   Using the `currentMapping`, determine the `meaning` of `sound`.
        *   **Apply the `meaning` as a constraint** to `possibleDigits[j]`:
            *   If `meaning` is `CORRECT`: The `possibleDigits[j]` must be exactly `{attemptDigit}`. If `attemptDigit` was not previously in `possibleDigits[j]`, this mapping is contradictory and thus invalid.
            *   If `meaning` is `ADJACENT`: The `possibleDigits[j]` must only contain digits that are adjacent to `attemptDigit`. Remove all other digits from `possibleDigits[j]`.
            *   If `meaning` is `INCORRECT`: The `possibleDigits[j]` must not contain `attemptDigit` or any digits adjacent to `attemptDigit`. Remove these digits from `possibleDigits[j]`.
        *   If at any point, any `possibleDigits[j]` set becomes empty, it indicates a contradiction for the current mapping. This mapping is invalid; stop processing it and move to the next mapping.
    c.  **Generate Combinations from Valid Mapping:** If a mapping survives all attempts without contradiction, it defines a refined set of `possibleDigits` for each position. We then generate all possible safe combinations by picking one digit from each `possibleDigits[j]` set. This is done using a recursive backtracking approach.
    d.  **Filter "Failed Attempts":** The problem states, "Each previous attempt (which is always a failed one)". This means that any generated combination that *exactly matches* one of the input attempts is not a valid solution. We filter these out.

4.  **Collect Overall Solutions:**
    All unique, valid combinations (after filtering "failed attempts") found from all valid sound-meaning mappings are added to a global `Set` (`overallPossibleCombinations`).

5.  **Determine Final Output:**
    *   If `overallPossibleCombinations` contains exactly one combination, output that combination.
    *   Otherwise (if it contains zero or more than one combination), output "FLEE". The problem guarantees "There is always at least one possibility", so `overallPossibleCombinations` will never be empty.

**Example Walkthrough (revisiting the problem's example for Assumption 1):**
Input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
1 2 4 5
1 2 4 8
CLICK CLICK CLACK CLUCK
CLICK CLICK CLUCK CLICK
CLICK CLICK CLUCK CLACK
```

Let's test the mapping: `CLICK = CORRECT`, `CLUCK = ADJACENT`, `CLACK = INCORRECT`.

Initial `possibleDigits` for a 4-digit code:
`P[0] = {0..9}`
`P[1] = {0..9}`
`P[2] = {0..9}`
`P[3] = {0..9}`

**Attempt 1: `1 2 3 4`, `CLICK CLICK CLACK CLUCK`**
- P0: `1` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[0] = {1}`.
- P1: `2` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[1] = {2}`.
- P2: `3` (CLACK -> INCORRECT). Remove 3 and its adjacents (2,4) from `P[2]`. `P[2]` becomes `{0,1,5,6,7,8,9}`.
- P3: `4` (CLUCK -> ADJACENT). Keep only digits adjacent to 4 ({3,5}) in `P[3]`. `P[3]` becomes `{3,5}`.
`Current P`: `P[0]={1}, P[1]={2}, P[2]={0,1,5,6,7,8,9}, P[3]={3,5}`

**Attempt 2: `1 2 4 5`, `CLICK CLICK CLUCK CLICK`**
- P0: `1` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[0]` stays `{1}`.
- P1: `2` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[1]` stays `{2}`.
- P2: `4` (CLUCK -> ADJACENT). Keep only digits adjacent to 4 ({3,5}) in `P[2]`. `P[2]` is `{0,1,5,6,7,8,9}`. Intersecting with `{3,5}` gives `{5}`. So `P[2]` becomes `{5}`.
- P3: `5` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[3]` must be `{5}`. `P[3]` is `{3,5}`. Intersecting with `{5}` gives `{5}`. So `P[3]` becomes `{5}`.
`Current P`: `P[0]={1}, P[1]={2}, P[2]={5}, P[3]={5}`

**Attempt 3: `1 2 4 8`, `CLICK CLICK CLUCK CLACK`**
- P0: `1` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[0]` stays `{1}`.
- P1: `2` (CLICK -> CORRECT). `P[1]` stays `{2}`.
- P2: `4` (CLUCK -> ADJACENT). `P[2]` is `{5}`. `4` is adjacent to `5`. Consistent. `P[2]` stays `{5}`.
- P3: `8` (CLACK -> INCORRECT). `P[3]` is `{5}`. `8` is not `5` and not adjacent to `5` ({4,6}). Consistent. `P[3]` stays `{5}`.

No contradictions found. This mapping is valid. The `possibleDigits` sets are now:
`P[0] = {1}`
`P[1] = {2}`
`P[2] = {5}`
`P[3] = {5}`

This mapping leads to the single combination "1 2 5 5".
We check if "1 2 5 5" matches any of the input attempts:
- `1 2 3 4` (No)
- `1 2 4 5` (No)
- `1 2 4 8` (No)
Since "1 2 5 5" does not match any failed attempt, it is added to `overallPossibleCombinations`.

If other mappings were tried and found contradictory (as in the example's Assumption 2 and 3), then `overallPossibleCombinations` would only contain "1 2 5 5".
Since `overallPossibleCombinations.size` is 1, the output is "1 2 5 5".
