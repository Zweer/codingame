The puzzle asks us to simulate a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selection process based on pre-recorded playouts. We need to construct an MCTS tree, populate its nodes with visit counts and score sums, and then use the UCB1 formula to determine the optimal sequence of moves.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Tree Node Structure**:
    We'll define a `Node` class. Each node represents a state in the game (a sequence of moves). It needs to store:
    *   `scoreSum`: The sum of scores from all playouts that passed through this node.
    *   `visits`: The number of playouts that passed through this node.
    *   `children`: A `Map` where keys are single move characters (strings) and values are `Node` objects, representing the next possible moves from this state.

2.  **Building the Tree**:
    *   We'll read `N` playouts. Each playout consists of a sequence of moves (a string) and its associated score.
    *   We start with a `root` node initialized with `scoreSum = 0` and `visits = 0`.
    *   For each playout (`sequence`, `score`):
        *   We traverse the tree from the `root` following the `sequence` of moves.
        *   For every node encountered along this path (including the final leaf node of the playout), we increment its `visits` count by 1 and add the `score` to its `scoreSum`.
        *   If a move in the `sequence` leads to a child node that doesn't exist yet, we create a new `Node` for it and add it to the current node's `children` map.

3.  **UCB1 Selection**:
    *   After the tree is built, we need to find the optimal path. We start from the `root` node.
    *   At each `currentNode`, we evaluate all its children using the UCB1 formula:
        `UCB1 = (M.s / M.v) + C * sqrt(ln(N.v) / M.v)`
        where:
        *   `M.s` is the `scoreSum` of the child node `M`.
        *   `M.v` is the `visits` count of the child node `M`.
        *   `N.v` is the `visits` count of the parent node `N` (`currentNode`).
        *   `C` is the given exploration constant.
    *   We select the child with the highest UCB1 value.
    *   **Tie-breaking**: If multiple children have the same highest UCB1 value, the one corresponding to the alphabetically smaller move character is chosen. This is handled by sorting the child moves alphabetically before evaluating them.
    *   We append the chosen move to our `currentPath` string and move to the selected child node.
    *   This process continues until a stopping condition is met.

4.  **Stopping Conditions**:
    This is the trickiest part, as the puzzle example provides a specific stopping behavior that deviates slightly from standard MCTS:
    *   **Condition 1 (True Leaf)**: If the `currentNode` has no children (`currentNode.children.size === 0`), it's a true leaf of the MCTS tree (no further moves observed in any playout from this state). The selection stops.
    *   **Condition 2 (Determined Path)**: The example states: "As there are no further nodes in MCTS tree along that paths, the 1-move sequence `a` is the answer." This implies stopping if the path taken from this node is essentially "deterministic" based on the provided playouts. We interpret this as: if the `currentNode` has been visited only once (`currentNode.visits === 1`), and it has exactly one child (`currentNode.children.size === 1`), AND that child has also been visited only once (meaning that only one playout ever passed through `currentNode`, and it always continued through that single child), then we stop. This signifies that the path from this point has no observed branching.

    If neither stopping condition is met, the UCB1 selection proceeds to the next node.

ab 20
bbb 4
```

**Tree Building (Final State):**

*   `root`: `v=3, s=54`
    *   `b`: `v=2, s=34`
        *   `a`: `v=1, s=30` (`node_ba`)
            *   `a`: `v=1, s=30` (`node_baa`, leaf)
        *   `b`: `v=1, s=4` (`node_bb`)
            *   `b`: `v=1, s=4` (`node_bbb`, leaf)
    *   `a`: `v=1, s=20` (`node_a`)
        *   `b`: `v=1, s=20` (`node_ab`, leaf)

**UCB1 Selection (C = 0.1):**

1.  **At `root`**: `currentNode = root`, `currentPath = ''`.
    *   `root.children.size` is 2 (>0). Not a true leaf.
    *   `root.visits` is 3 (not 1). Stopping condition 2 not met.
    *   Children: `a`, `b`. Sorted: `a`, `b`.
        *   For `a` (`node_a`): `M.s=20, M.v=1`. `N.v=3`.
            UCB1(`a`) = `20/1 + 0.1 * sqrt(ln(3)/1)` = `20 + 0.1 * sqrt(1.0986)` = `20 + 0.1048` = `20.1048`.
        *   For `b` (`node_b`): `M.s=34, M.v=2`. `N.v=3`.
            UCB1(`b`) = `34/2 + 0.1 * sqrt(ln(3)/2)` = `17 + 0.1 * sqrt(0.5493)` = `17 + 0.0741` = `17.0741`.
    *   `a` has higher UCB1. `bestMove = 'a'`.
    *   `currentPath` becomes `'a'`. `currentNode` becomes `node_a`.

2.  **At `node_a`**: `currentNode = node_a`, `currentPath = 'a'`.
    *   `node_a.children.size` is 1 (>0). Not a true leaf.
    *   **Stopping Condition 2 check**:
        *   `node_a.visits` is 1. (Matches)
        *   `node_a.children.size` is 1. (Matches)
        *   The only child is `node_ab`. `node_ab.visits` is 1. (Matches)
        *   All conditions met. **STOP**.

Final `currentPath` is `a`. This matches the example output.
