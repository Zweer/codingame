The problem asks us to simulate a chain reaction of falling apples. We are given `N` apples, each described by its `(x, y, z)` center coordinates and `r` radius. One apple `i` initially starts falling straight down (meaning its `x` and `y` coordinates remain constant, only `z` decreases). When a falling apple hits a static apple, that static apple also begins to fall. We need to determine how many apples remain on the tree after the entire process concludes.

**Core Logic:**

1.  **Falling Propagation:** This problem can be modeled as a graph traversal problem, specifically a Breadth-First Search (BFS). We start with the initially falling apple. Any apple it causes to fall is then added to a queue, and we process them similarly. This ensures that all apples that are "knocked off" are identified.

2.  **Collision Detection:** The crucial part is to determine when a falling apple `F` (with center `(x_F, y_F, z_F)` and radius `r_F`) hits a static apple `S` (with center `(x_S, y_S, z_S)` and radius `r_S`). Since `F` falls straight down, its `x` and `y` coordinates are fixed.

    A collision occurs if two conditions are met:
    *   **Horizontal Overlap:** The 2D projection of `F` onto the XY plane must overlap with the 2D projection of `S` onto the XY plane enough for their spheres to touch. This means the horizontal distance between their centers (`d_xy`) must be less than or equal to the sum of their radii (`r_F + r_S`). We can calculate `d_xy^2 = (x_F - x_S)^2 + (y_F - y_S)^2` and compare it to `(r_F + r_S)^2` to avoid square roots and floating-point issues, and for better performance. So, `(x_F - x_S)^2 + (y_F - y_S)^2 <= (r_F + r_S)^2`.
    *   **Vertical Reachability:** The falling apple `F` must be able to reach the static apple `S` vertically. Since `F` falls from its initial `z_F` downwards, it can hit `S` if its highest point (`z_F + r_F`) is at or above the lowest point of `S` (`z_S - r_S`). If `z_F + r_F < z_S - r_S`, then `S` is entirely above `F` (or `F` is entirely below `S` if `z_F` is very low), and `F` cannot hit `S` by falling.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Read Input:**
    *   Read `N` (total number of apples) and `initialFallingAppleIndex`.
    *   Read `N` lines, each containing `x, y, z, r` for an apple. Store these in an array of `Apple` objects.

2.  **Initialize State:**
    *   Create a boolean array `isFalling` of size `N`, initialized to `false`. This array will keep track of which apples have started falling.
    *   Create a queue (e.g., a simple array in JavaScript) and add `initialFallingAppleIndex` to it. Mark `isFalling[initialFallingAppleIndex]` as `true`.

3.  **BFS Traversal:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue an apple's index, let's call it `currentFallingIndex`. This is the apple whose collisions we are currently checking.
        *   For every other apple `staticAppleIndex` from `0` to `N-1`:
            *   If `staticAppleIndex` is the same as `currentFallingIndex`, or if `isFalling[staticAppleIndex]` is already `true`, skip (this apple is already falling or will fall).
            *   Otherwise, perform the collision checks described above:
                *   Calculate `horizontalDistSq = (currentFallingApple.x - staticApple.x)^2 + (currentFallingApple.y - staticApple.y)^2`.
                *   Calculate `rSumSq = (currentFallingApple.r + staticApple.r)^2`.
                *   If `horizontalDistSq <= rSumSq` (horizontal overlap) AND `currentFallingApple.z + currentFallingApple.r >= staticApple.z - staticApple.r` (vertical reachability):
                    *   The `staticApple` is hit and begins to fall.
                    *   Mark `isFalling[staticAppleIndex] = true`.
                    *   Enqueue `staticAppleIndex` to process its potential chain reactions later.

4.  **Count Remaining Apples:**
    *   After the BFS loop finishes, iterate through the `isFalling` array.
    *   Count how many apples have `isFalling[i]` as `false`. This is the number of apples that remain on the tree.
    *   Print this count.

**Efficiency:**
*   `N` is up to 100.
*   The BFS will process each apple at most once from the queue.
*   For each apple processed from the queue, it iterates through `N-1` other apples.
*   Each collision check involves a few arithmetic operations.
*   Total operations roughly `N * N`, which for `N=100` is `100 * 100 = 10,000` operations, well within typical time limits.
*   Coordinates and radii can be large (`1,000,000`), but their squares (`(2*10^6)^2 = 4*10^12`) fit comfortably within JavaScript's 64-bit floating-point numbers (which provide integer precision up to `2^53 - 1`, approximately `9 * 10^15`).
