The problem asks us to place a given number of dumbbells (`n`) onto a grid of `h` rows and `w` columns. The initial grid contains `.` (empty squares) and `o` (potential weight locations). Each dumbbell occupies three squares: two weights at the ends and a bar in the middle, either horizontally (`o-o`) or vertically (`o|o`).

Here are the key rules and constraints:
1.  **Dumbbell Structure**: A dumbbell is `o-o` or `o|o`. The `o`s are weights, `-` or `|` is the bar.
2.  **Occupancy**: Dumbbells can touch but not cross. This means no square can be occupied by more than one part of any dumbbell (weight or bar).
3.  **Weight Rules**:
    *   Each square contains at most one weight (`o`).
    *   Each weight is the end of a *single* dumbbell. This implies that if a square is marked `o`, it's an endpoint, and it cannot be shared by two dumbbells, nor can it be part of the bar.
    *   Initial `o`s are fixed weight locations. This is crucial: if an input square is `o`, it *must* become an endpoint of *exactly one* dumbbell. A `.` square can become an `o` endpoint, a bar, or remain `.`.
4.  **Unique Solution**: All problems have a unique solution. This allows us to stop the search as soon as the first valid solution is found.
5.  **Constraints**: `n` is 3-15, `h, w` are 3-8. These small constraints suggest that a backtracking approach will be feasible.

**Approach: Backtracking**

We will use a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible placements of dumbbells. The state of our search will include:
*   The current configuration of the grid (`currentGrid`).
*   The number of dumbbells successfully placed so far (`dumbbellsPlaced`).
*   The count of initial `o`s that still need to be used as an endpoint (`initialOsRemaining`).
*   A mechanism to track which initial `o`s have been used (`initialOsUsedCount`).
*   The starting coordinates `(searchFromRow, searchFromCol)` for the next search iteration. This optimizes the search by avoiding redundant checks of cells that have already been considered in the current branch.

**Data Structures:**
*   `N_DUMBBELLS`, `H`, `W`: Global variables for input values.
*   `initialGridChars: string[][]`: Stores the grid as read from input. Used to distinguish initial `o`s from `.`s.
*   `isInitialO: boolean[][]`: A boolean array, `true` if the cell at `(r, c)` was originally an `o`.
*   `totalInitialOs: number`: Stores the total count of 'o's in the initial grid.
*   `solutionGrid: string[][]`: Stores the final grid configuration once a solution is found.
*   `foundSolution: boolean`: A flag to stop the search early once a solution is found (due to unique solution constraint).
*   `currentGrid: string[][]`: The grid representing the current state of dumbbell placements during recursion.
*   `initialOsUsedCount: number[][]`: Tracks for each cell `(r, c)` that was initially `o`, whether it has been used (value `1`) or not (value `0`) as a dumbbell endpoint. Since each `o` can only be part of *one* dumbbell, this will be 0 or 1.

**Core Logic (`solveDumbbells` function):**

`solveDumbbells(dumbbellsPlaced, initialOsRemaining, searchFromRow, searchFromCol)`

1.  **Base Cases & Pruning:**
    *   If `foundSolution` is `true`, return immediately.
    *   If `dumbbellsPlaced === N_DUMBBELLS`:
        *   If `initialOsRemaining === 0`, a valid solution has been found! Deep copy `currentGrid` to `solutionGrid`, set `foundSolution = true`, and return.
        *   Else (if `initialOsRemaining > 0`), this path failed to use all mandatory initial `o`s. Return.
    *   If `initialOsRemaining > (N_DUMBBELLS - dumbbellsPlaced) * 2`: This is an early pruning step. If the number of remaining initial `o`s is more than double the number of dumbbells left to place (because each dumbbell uses at most two endpoints), then it's impossible to use all mandatory `o`s. Return.

2.  **Iterate and Recurse:**
    *   Iterate through grid cells `(r, c)` starting from `(searchFromRow, searchFromCol)` to `(H-1, W-1)`.
    *   For each cell `(r, c)`:
        *   **Try placing a horizontal dumbbell**: `(r, c)-(r, c+2)` with midpoint `(r, c+1)`.
            *   Call `canPlace(r, c, r, c+2, r, c+1)` to check if this placement is valid according to all rules (bounds, cell availability, initial `o` usage).
            *   If valid:
                *   Call `place(r, c, r, c+2, r, c+1, '-')` to update `currentGrid` and `initialOsUsedCount`. This function also returns how many initial `o`s were just 'used' by this placement (0, 1, or 2).
                *   Recursively call `solveDumbbells(dumbbellsPlaced + 1, initialOsRemaining - usedCount, nextSearchRow, nextSearchCol)`. `nextSearchRow, nextSearchCol` is `(r, c + 1)` (or `(r+1, 0)` if `c+1` wraps around), ensuring we search forward.
                *   If `foundSolution` becomes `true` after the recursive call, return immediately.
                *   Call `unplace(r, c, r, c+2, r, c+1)` to revert `currentGrid` and `initialOsUsedCount` for backtracking.
        *   **Try placing a vertical dumbbell**: `(r, c)-(r+2, c)` with midpoint `(r+1, c)`.
            *   Similar logic as horizontal placement, calling `canPlace`, `place`, recursive `solveDumbbells`, checking `foundSolution`, and `unplace`.

**Helper Functions:**

*   `canPlace(r1, c1, r2, c2, r_mid, c_mid)`:
    *   Checks if all three cells are within grid bounds.
    *   Checks if `currentGrid[r_mid][c_mid]` is `.` (empty).
    *   Checks `currentGrid[r1][c1]` and `currentGrid[r2][c2]` (endpoints):
        *   If `.` (empty), it's valid to become an `o`.
        *   If `o`, it must be an `initial 'o'` that has not yet been used (`isInitialO[rc]` is true AND `initialOsUsedCount[rc]` is 0).
        *   If `-` or `|`, it's invalid.
*   `place(r1, c1, r2, c2, r_mid, c_mid, barChar)`:
    *   Modifies `currentGrid` to place the dumbbell (`o` at ends, `barChar` in middle).
    *   Updates `initialOsUsedCount` for `isInitialO` cells.
    *   Returns the number of initial `o`s consumed (0, 1, or 2).
*   `unplace(r1, c1, r2, c2, r_mid, c_mid)`:
    *   Reverts `currentGrid` and `initialOsUsedCount` to their state before the dumbbell was placed. If a cell was `initial 'o'`, it reverts to `'o'`, otherwise to `'.'`.

The `searchFromRow`, `searchFromCol` parameters in `solveDumbbells` are crucial for performance. They ensure that in any given recursive call, we only try to place dumbbells starting at or after the position that led to the current call. This avoids redundant work and cyclical searches.
