To solve the FreeCell puzzle, we need to choose the best possible move from a list of given valid moves. The game involves moving cards between cascades (8 columns), foundations (4 stacks, one per suit, aces up), and cells (4 temporary slots). The goal is to move all cards to the foundations. The game also features "autoplay," where any card that can be moved to a foundation is automatically moved there after every player action.

The strategy involves the following steps:

1.  **Parse the Game State:** Read the current configuration of foundations, cells, and cascades from the standard input.
2.  **Represent the Board:** Create data structures to hold the parsed game state. A `Card` interface will store rank, suit, and color. A `Board` class will encapsulate the foundations (as a map of suit to the highest rank placed), cells (array of `Card` or `null`), and cascades (array of `Card[]`, where the last element is the topmost/bottommost playable card).
3.  **Simulate Moves:** The `Board` class will have a `simulateMove` method that takes a proposed move and returns a *new* `Board` object representing the state after that move. This is crucial for evaluating moves without modifying the original state.
4.  **Simulate Autoplay:** The `Board` class will also have a `simulateAutoplay` method. This method will repeatedly check if any cards can be moved to their respective foundations from either cascades or cells and perform those moves. This accurately reflects the game's rule that autoplay happens *after* every move.
5.  **Evaluate Moves (Heuristic Scoring):** For each possible move provided by the game:
    *   Simulate the move.
    *   Immediately apply `simulateAutoplay` to the resulting board state.
    *   Calculate a score for this final board state. The heuristic prioritizes:
        *   **Foundation Progress:** Moving cards to foundations is the primary goal. We'll give a very high score for any card that ends up in a foundation after the move (and autoplay).
        *   **Empty Cascades:** Creating an empty cascade is extremely valuable as it enables "supermoves" (moving entire tableaux).
        *   **Empty Cells:** Freeing up a cell is also valuable for temporary storage.
        *   **Uncovering Cards:** Moving a card from a cascade reveals the card beneath it, potentially unblocking further moves.
        *   **Building Cascades:** Moving a card onto another cascade in a valid sequence helps organize the board.
        *   **Penalties:** Filling an empty cell without the card immediately moving to a foundation incurs a penalty, as cells are a limited resource.
6.  **Select Best Move:** Keep track of the move that results in the highest score.
7.  **Output the Move:** Print the chosen move string to standard output.

This greedy approach aims to make the "best" move in the current turn based on a simple heuristic, which is often sufficient for FreeCell.
