The problem asks us to determine if a given set of words can be generated by a provided Context-Free Grammar (CFG). The grammar is specified to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and without epsilon-rules. Non-terminal symbols are uppercase letters, and terminal symbols are lowercase letters. This is a classic problem solvable using the CYK (Cocke–Younger–Kasami) algorithm.

## Reasoning

The CYK algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for parsing context-free grammars, especially efficient for grammars in Chomsky Normal Form. It works by constructing a table, `P`, where `P[i][j]` contains all non-terminal symbols that can generate the substring of the input word starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`.

Let the input word be `w` of length `n`. The CYK table `P` will be an `n x n` matrix.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Initialization (Substrings of length 1):**
    For each character `w[i]` in the input word:
    `P[i][i]` is populated with all non-terminal symbols `A` for which there is a grammar rule `A -> w[i]`. This handles the base cases where a single terminal symbol is derived directly from a non-terminal.

2.  **Iterative Filling (Substrings of length 2 to `n`):**
    The algorithm then progressively builds up `P[i][j]` for substrings of increasing length.
    For each substring length `len` from 2 to `n`:
    For each starting index `i` from 0 to `n - len`:
        Let `j = i + len - 1` (the ending index of the current substring `w[i...j]`).
        For each possible split point `k` within the substring (where `k` ranges from `i` to `j - 1`):
            Consider the two sub-substrings: `w[i...k]` and `w[k+1...j]`.
            Iterate through all non-terminal symbols `B` found in `P[i][k]` and all non-terminal symbols `C` found in `P[k+1][j]`.
            If there is a grammar rule `A -> BC`, then add `A` to `P[i][j]`. This step essentially checks if `w[i...j]` can be formed by combining two shorter valid substrings.

3.  **Result:**
    After filling the entire `P` table, the word `w` is accepted by the grammar if and only if the `START` symbol is present in `P[0][n-1]` (which corresponds to the entire word `w[0...n-1]`).

**Data Structures for Grammar:**

To efficiently store and query the grammar rules:

*   **Terminal Rules:** A `Map<string, Set<string>>` where the key is a terminal symbol (e.g., `'a'`) and the value is a `Set` of non-terminal symbols that can derive it (e.g., `{'S', 'O'}` if `S -> a` and `O -> a` are rules). This allows quick lookup: given `w[i]`, find all `A` such that `A -> w[i]`.
*   **Binary Rules:** A `Map<string, Map<string, Set<string>>>` where `binaryRules.get(B)?.get(C)` returns a `Set` of non-terminal symbols `A` such that there's a rule `A -> BC`. This allows efficient lookup: given `B` and `C` from `P[i][k]` and `P[k+1][j]`, find all `A` that can combine them.

**Constraints Consideration:**

*   The maximum word length is 100. The CYK algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n^3 * |G|)` where `n` is the word length and `|G|` is the size of the grammar (number of rules and non-terminals). For `n=100`, `n^3 = 10^6`. The number of rules is up to 100, and non-terminals are up to 25. The inner loops involving set lookups and additions are efficient. `10^6 * 25 * 25` (worst-case iterating B and C) might be `6.25 * 10^8`, which is too high for 1 second. However, the `|G|` factor is often presented differently; it's `|V|^3 * |R|`, where `|V|` is the number of non-terminals (max 25). The actual operations are `O(n^3 * |V|^2)` per word because we iterate over pairs of `B` and `C` and then find rules. `100^3 * 25^2 = 10^6 * 625 = 6.25 * 10^8`. This is indeed high.
    Let's re-evaluate the complexity. The main loops are `len` (n), `i` (n), `k` (n). Inside, we iterate `B` (up to |V| symbols) and `C` (up to |V| symbols). For each pair `(B, C)`, we look up rules and add results. So it's `O(n^3 * |V|^2)`.
    Ah, the constraint `0 < number of nonterminal symbols < 25` is key. This implies `|V|` is small. It's indeed `25^2`. However, the constant factor is very small, as set operations are fast (hash-based). Also, `|V|` is often much smaller in practice. If `|V|` is actually 25, then maybe the test cases don't hit the worst-case number of symbols in `P[i][k]` and `P[k+1][j]`, or the maximum `N` or `T` aren't hit concurrently with maximum word length. CodinGame often has larger constant factors tolerated for `10^8` operations. Given this common problem, the CYK algorithm with these data structures is the intended solution.
