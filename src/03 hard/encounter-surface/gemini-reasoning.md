The problem asks us to find the area of the intersection of two convex polygons, referred to as the "Encounter Surface." The input consists of the vertices of two polygons, but they are not necessarily given in order. The final area should be rounded up to the nearest integer.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the number of vertices for each polygon and their coordinates.

2.  **Order Polygon Vertices:** Since the vertices are not guaranteed to be in order, we must sort them to form a valid, counter-clockwise (CCW) ordered convex polygon. A common approach for this is similar to the first step of the Graham Scan algorithm:
    *   Find the point with the lowest Y-coordinate. If there's a tie, pick the one with the lowest X-coordinate. This point becomes the pivot (`p0`).
    *   Sort all other points by their polar angle relative to `p0`. Points with a smaller polar angle come first. If two points are collinear with `p0`, the one closer to `p0` should come first.
    *   After sorting, iterate through the sorted list to remove any redundant collinear points (i.e., points that lie strictly between two other vertices on a straight edge).

3.  **Polygon Intersection (Sutherland-Hodgman Algorithm):** This algorithm is well-suited for clipping one convex polygon by another.
    *   Initialize an `outputList` with the vertices of the first polygon (the "subject polygon").
    *   For each edge of the second polygon (the "clip polygon"):
        *   Take the current `outputList` as the `inputList`. Clear the `outputList`.
        *   For each edge `(S1, S2)` of the `inputList`:
            *   Determine if `S1` and `S2` are "inside" the half-plane defined by the current clip edge. "Inside" means to the left of or on the directed clip edge (assuming CCW winding).
            *   Apply the Sutherland-Hodgman rules:
                *   If `S2` is inside:
                    *   If `S1` is outside, add the intersection point of `(S1, S2)` and the clip edge to `outputList`.
                    *   Always add `S2` to `outputList`.
                *   If `S2` is outside:
                    *   If `S1` is inside, add the intersection point of `(S1, S2)` and the clip edge to `outputList`.
                    *   If `S1` is also outside, add nothing.
    *   After iterating through all clip edges, the final `outputList` contains the vertices of the intersection polygon.

4.  **Calculate Area (Shoelace Formula):** Once we have the ordered vertices of the intersection polygon, we can calculate its area using the Shoelace Formula. For a polygon with vertices `(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)`:
    `Area = 0.5 * | (x1*y2 + x2*y3 + ... + xn*y1) - (y1*x2 + y2*x3 + ... + yn*x1) |`

5.  **Round Up:** The problem requires rounding the final area *up* to the nearest integer, so `Math.ceil()` is applied.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Floating-Point Precision:** Geometric calculations involving division (like finding intersection points) can introduce floating-point inaccuracies. A small `EPSILON` value (e.g., `1e-9`) is used for comparisons (e.g., checking if a value is close to zero, or if a point is "on" a line) to mitigate these issues.
*   **Collinearity and Degenerate Polygons:**
    *   The `orderPolygonVertices` function explicitly handles collinear points to ensure the output polygon only includes essential vertices.
    *   If a polygon becomes degenerate (e.g., fewer than 3 vertices) after ordering, or if the intersection polygon ends up with fewer than 3 vertices, its area is 0.
    *   The problem states "sides of the polygons can be superposed." The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm naturally handles this because points lying on the clipping edge are considered "inside" (due to `EPSILON` in `isInside` check), and their vertices will be included in the output.
