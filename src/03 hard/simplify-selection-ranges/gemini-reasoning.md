The puzzle asks us to simplify an array of numbers by replacing consecutive sequences of three or more numbers with a range shorthand (e.g., `5,6,7` becomes `5-7`). Numbers not part of such a sequence, or part of a sequence shorter than three, should remain as individual numbers. The final output must be a comma-separated string, with all numbers/ranges sorted from lowest to highest.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Parse Input:** The input is a string representing a JavaScript array (e.g., `"[1,2,3]"`). We first need to remove the leading `[` and trailing `]` characters. Then, split the resulting string by commas to get individual number strings, and convert these strings to actual numbers. An empty input array `[]` should result in an empty string `""`.

2.  **Sort Numbers:** Although the example input is already sorted, the problem explicitly states the output should be sorted. It's good practice to sort the parsed numbers numerically to ensure correctness for all possible inputs.

3.  **Identify and Process Ranges:**
    *   Iterate through the sorted array of numbers.
    *   Maintain a `currentRange` array to accumulate consecutive numbers.
    *   If the current number is one greater than the last number in `currentRange`, it's part of the same sequence, so add it to `currentRange`.
    *   If the current number is *not* consecutive (i.e., it breaks the sequence), the `currentRange` has ended. At this point, we process the `currentRange`:
        *   If `currentRange` has 3 or more numbers, format it as `start-end` (e.g., `range[0]-range[range.length - 1]`).
        *   If `currentRange` has fewer than 3 numbers (1 or 2), add each number individually to the output.
    *   After processing the `currentRange`, start a new `currentRange` with the current non-consecutive number.

4.  **Handle the Last Range:** After the loop finishes, there will always be one `currentRange` that hasn't been processed yet (the one ending at the very last number of the input array). Ensure this final `currentRange` is also processed and added to the output list.

5.  **Format Output:** Finally, join all the processed number strings and range strings with a comma to form the final result.

**Example Walkthrough (using `[1,2,5,6,7]`):**

1.  **Parse & Sort:** `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7]`
2.  **Initialize:** `resultParts = []`, `currentRange = []`
3.  **Iterate:**
    *   `num = 1`: `currentRange` is empty, add `1`. `currentRange = [1]`.
    *   `num = 2`: `2` is `1+1`, add `2`. `currentRange = [1, 2]`.
    *   `num = 5`: `5` is not `2+1`. `currentRange` (`[1, 2]`) has ended.
        *   Length is 2 (less than 3). Add `1` then `2` to `resultParts`. `resultParts = ["1", "2"]`.
        *   Start new `currentRange = [5]`.
    *   `num = 6`: `6` is `5+1`, add `6`. `currentRange = [5, 6]`.
    *   `num = 7`: `7` is `6+1`, add `7`. `currentRange = [5, 6, 7]`.
4.  **End of Loop:** The loop finishes. Process the final `currentRange` (`[5, 6, 7]`).
    *   Length is 3 (or more). Format as `5-7`. Add `5-7` to `resultParts`. `resultParts = ["1", "2", "5-7"]`.
5.  **Join:** `resultParts.join(',')` results in `"1,2,5-7"`.
