The problem asks us to calculate the total earnings from a roller coaster attraction over `C` rides. We are given the attraction's capacity `L`, the number of rides `C`, the initial number of groups `N`, and the size `P_i` of each group. Key rules are: groups stay together, they queue up, and after a ride, they return to the back of the queue in the same order. If a group at the front of the queue doesn't fit, the ride starts with the groups already on board. Each person pays 1 dirham.

**Understanding the Constraints and Problem:**
The most critical constraints are `C` (number of rides) can be up to `10^7`, while `N` (number of groups) is relatively small, up to `1000`. A direct simulation of `C` rides would be `O(C * N)` in the worst case (if many groups fit on each ride), leading to `10^7 * 1000 = 10^{10}` operations, which is too slow. This indicates that we need to detect a pattern or cycle in the system's state.

**State Definition for Cycle Detection:**
The state of the system is determined by the order of groups in the queue. Since groups always return to the end in the same relative order, the only thing that changes is *which* group is currently at the front of the queue. We can identify the state by the `index` of the group that is at the front of the conceptual circular queue (which is built upon the original `groups` array). There are `N` possible `currentHeadIndex` values (0 to N-1). This means the system's state must repeat after at most `N` rides (specifically, `N` distinct states, plus one more ride to detect the cycle).

**Algorithm with Cycle Detection:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize `totalEarnings = 0`.
    *   Initialize `ridesCompleted = 0`.
    *   Initialize `currentHeadIndex = 0` (pointing to the first group in the original `groups` array).
    *   Create a `Map` called `memo` to store visited states. The key will be `currentHeadIndex`, and the value will be an object `{ ridesTaken: number, earningsBeforeRide: number }`, representing the number of rides completed and total earnings *before* starting the ride from that `currentHeadIndex`.

2.  **Simulation Loop:**
    Continue the loop `while (ridesCompleted < C)`:

    a.  **Check for Cycle:**
        Before starting a new ride, check if `currentHeadIndex` has been seen before in `memo`.
        If `memo.has(currentHeadIndex)` is true:
        *   Retrieve the `prevState` from `memo` associated with this `currentHeadIndex`.
        *   Calculate the `cycleLength = ridesCompleted - prevState.ridesTaken`. This is the number of rides in one full cycle.
        *   Calculate the `cycleEarnings = totalEarnings - prevState.earningsBeforeRide`. This is the earnings accumulated during one full cycle.
        *   Calculate `remainingRides = C - ridesCompleted`.
        *   Calculate `numCycles = Math.floor(remainingRides / cycleLength)`. This is how many full cycles can fit into the remaining rides.
        *   Add `numCycles * cycleEarnings` to `totalEarnings`.
        *   Add `numCycles * cycleLength` to `ridesCompleted`.
        *   Break out of the main simulation loop, as we've extrapolated the earnings for all full cycles.

    b.  **Store Current State:**
        If `currentHeadIndex` is not in `memo` (this is the first time we're reaching this state), store it:
        `memo.set(currentHeadIndex, { ridesTaken: ridesCompleted, earningsBeforeRide: totalEarnings });`

    c.  **Simulate One Ride:**
        *   Initialize `ridersOnThisRide = 0`.
        *   Initialize `currentCapacity = L`.
        *   Initialize `groupsOnRideCount = 0`.
        *   Use a temporary index `tempHeadIndex = currentHeadIndex` to iterate through groups for the current ride without changing `currentHeadIndex` until the ride is complete.
        *   Loop to add groups: For `i` from `0` to `N-1` (to ensure we don't go past considering all groups if they fit):
            *   Get `groupSize = groups[tempHeadIndex]`.
            *   If `groupSize <= currentCapacity`:
                *   Add `groupSize` to `ridersOnThisRide`.
                *   Decrease `currentCapacity` by `groupSize`.
                *   Increment `groupsOnRideCount`.
                *   Move `tempHeadIndex` to the next group: `tempHeadIndex = (tempHeadIndex + 1) % N`.
            *   Else (group doesn't fit): Break the inner loop.
            *   If `currentCapacity` becomes `0` (attraction is full): Break the inner loop.

        *   Update `totalEarnings += ridersOnThisRide`.
        *   Increment `ridesCompleted++`.
        *   Update `currentHeadIndex = tempHeadIndex` (this is the new starting group for the next ride).

3.  **Output:**
    After the loop finishes (either `ridesCompleted >= C` or a cycle was detected and extrapolated), print `totalEarnings`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   The initial simulation (before a cycle is detected) runs for at most `N+1` rides (since there are `N` distinct states for `currentHeadIndex`).
*   Each ride simulation involves an inner loop that iterates at most `N` times (once for each group).
*   Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(N * N)` or `O(N^2)`.
*   Given `N <= 1000`, `N^2 = 1000^2 = 10^6`, which is well within typical time limits (usually 1 second for `10^8` operations).
*   Space complexity is `O(N)` for storing the `groups` array and the `memo` map.

**Edge Cases:**
*   `N=1`: A cycle will be detected immediately after the first ride (the head index will return to 0). The `cycleLength` will be 1.
*   `P_i = L`: A single group can take all `L` spots.
*   `C` is small: The loop will simply run `C` times without necessarily detecting a cycle.

This approach efficiently handles the large `C` values by exploiting the cyclic nature of the queue states.
