The problem asks us to determine the most probable computational complexity from a predefined list, given a set of performance measures `(num, time)`. This is a curve fitting problem where we need to find which of the given Big O functions best describes the observed execution times.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We are given `N` data points, each consisting of `num` (number of items processed) and `t` (execution time). We need to select the best fit among the following complexities:
`O(1)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n)`, `O(n log n)`, `O(n^2)`, `O(n^2 log n)`, `O(n^3)`, `O(2^n)`.

A Big O complexity `O(f(n))` implies that the execution time `T(n)` is approximately proportional to `f(n)` for large `n`. That is, `T(n) â‰ˆ C * f(n)` for some constant `C`.

**Approach: Least Squares Regression**

The most common method to find the "best fit" for a linear relationship like `Y = C * X` is the method of least squares. Here, `Y` is the observed time `t`, and `X` is `f(n)`. We want to find the constant `C` that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed times `t_i` and the predicted times `C * f(n_i)`.

The formula for the optimal `C` that minimizes `Sum((t_i - C * f(n_i))^2)` is:
`C = Sum(t_i * f(n_i)) / Sum(f(n_i)^2)`

Once `C` is found for a given `f(n)`, we calculate the total squared error (sum of squared differences):
`Error = Sum((t_i - C * f(n_i))^2)`

The complexity with the minimum `Error` will be our answer.

**Steps:**

1.  **Define Complexity Functions:** Create a list of objects, each containing the name of a complexity (e.g., "O(n)") and a JavaScript function `func(n)` that calculates `f(n)` for a given `n`.
    *   `O(1)`: `f(n) = 1`
    *   `O(log n)`: `f(n) = Math.log(n)` (using natural logarithm)
    *   `O(n)`: `f(n) = n`
    *   `O(n log n)`: `f(n) = n * Math.log(n)`
    *   `O(n^2)`: `f(n) = n * n`
    *   `O(n^2 log n)`: `f(n) = n * n * Math.log(n)`
    *   `O(n^3)`: `f(n) = n * n * n`
    *   `O(2^n)`: `f(n) = Math.pow(2, n)`

2.  **Iterate Through Complexities:** For each defined complexity:
    a.  **Calculate Sums for `C`:** Iterate through all data points `(n_i, t_i)`:
        *   Calculate `x_prime = f(n_i)`.
        *   Accumulate `sum_XY += t_i * x_prime`.
        *   Accumulate `sum_X2 += x_prime * x_prime`.
    b.  **Handle Edge Cases/Overflow:**
        *   The input `num` values are `> 5`, so `Math.log(n)` and other polynomial functions will return positive, finite numbers.
        *   However, `Math.pow(2, n)` for large `n` (e.g., `n > 60` or so) can become `Infinity` in JavaScript's `number` type. If `f(n)` returns `Infinity` for any data point, it means this theoretical complexity grows astronomically fast compared to the measured `t_i` (which are finite). In such cases, this complexity is clearly a poor fit, and we should assign it an `Infinity` error to disqualify it.
        *   If `sum_X2` is zero (meaning all `x_prime` values were zero), or if there are fewer than 2 valid points, we also assign `Infinity` error.
    c.  **Calculate Optimal `C`:** `bestC = sum_XY / sum_X2`.
    d.  **Calculate Total Squared Error:** Iterate through all data points again:
        *   Calculate `predicted_t = bestC * f(n_i)`.
        *   Add `(t_i - predicted_t)^2` to a running sum for `currentError`.
    e.  **Track Best Fit:** Keep track of the `minError` found so far and the `name` of the complexity that produced it.

3.  **Output:** Print the `name` of the complexity with the `minError`.

**Precision Considerations:**
JavaScript's `number` type is a 64-bit floating-point number. While `sum_XY` and `sum_X2` can grow quite large (up to `10^17` or more), they generally remain within the range representable by floating-point numbers. The key is that `Infinity` handling correctly prunes the `O(2^n)` complexity when `n` is large enough to cause overflows, which is appropriate for the problem's constraints.

**Example Test (Provided in Problem Description):**
Input data for `O(n)` complexity:
10
5 341
1005 26324
2005 52585
3005 78877
4005 104925
4805 125920
6105 159156
7205 188017
8105 211417
9905 258991

For this input, the expected output is `O(n)`. This confirms that the least squares approach for `T(n) = C * f(n)` is the intended model.
