The puzzle asks us to simulate a Breakout-like game. A dimensionless ball bounces around a playfield, breaking bricks and scoring points until it falls off the bottom. The paddle moves to a new predefined location each time it is hit.

**Simulation Approach:**

The core of this problem is efficiently determining the next collision. Instead of simulating the ball's movement pixel by pixel, which would be too slow, we can use a "ray casting" approach:

1.  **Calculate Time to Collision (`minTime`):** In each step of the simulation loop, we calculate the time it would take for the ball to hit any active object (walls, paddle, or any remaining brick).
    *   For each potential collision, `t = (target_coordinate - current_coordinate) / velocity`.
    *   We are only interested in collisions that occur in the future (`t > 0`).
    *   We find the `minTime` among all possible collisions.

2.  **Move the Ball:** Once `minTime` is determined, we advance the ball's position to the exact point of this first collision:
    *   `ballX += ballVX * minTime`
    *   `ballY += ballVY * minTime`

3.  **Process Collision:**
    *   **Reflection:** Based on the `hitSide` (top/bottom/left/right), we reverse the appropriate velocity component (`ballVY = -ballVY` for horizontal surfaces, `ballVX = -ballVX` for vertical surfaces).
    *   **Brick Interaction:** If a brick is hit, its `strength` is decremented. If `strength` reaches 0, the brick is considered "broken", and its `points` are added to the `totalPoints`. Broken bricks are then ignored in future collision calculations.
    *   **Paddle Movement:** If the paddle is hit, it moves to its next predefined position. The `currentPaddleIndex` is incremented, ensuring it doesn't exceed the available paddle positions.

4.  **Nudging:** Due to floating-point precision, the ball might land exactly on or slightly past the collision surface. To prevent immediate re-collision with the same surface in the next step, we "nudge" the ball a tiny `EPSILON` distance away from the surface after reflection.

5.  **Loss Condition:** We also calculate the `timeToBottom` (time to hit the bottom of the playfield). If `minTime` is `Infinity` (no obstacles in path) or if `minTime` is greater than or equal to `timeToBottom`, it means the ball falls off the bottom before hitting anything else. In this case, the game ends.

**Data Structures:**

*   `Brick`: An interface to store `x`, `y` coordinates, `strength`, and `points` for each brick. A unique `id` is also added, though not strictly necessary if we pass the object reference around.
*   `PaddlePosition`: An interface to store `x` and `y` coordinates for each paddle configuration.

**Floating-Point Precision (`EPSILON`):**

A small constant `EPSILON` (e.g., `1e-6`) is used throughout the simulation for robust floating-point comparisons:
*   When checking if `t > 0`: `t > EPSILON` ensures we only consider future collisions, not current (already touching) ones.
*   When checking if the collision point lies within the bounds of an object: `hitX >= obj.x - EPSILON && hitX <= obj.x + obj.width + EPSILON` adds a small tolerance.
*   When nudging the ball after a bounce: `ballY = 0 + EPSILON` (for top wall), `ballX = brick.x - EPSILON` (for brick left side), etc., slightly moves the ball off the surface to avoid immediate re-detection of the same collision.

**Constraints and Performance:**

*   The playfield is 1600x2400. Max velocity is 100.
*   The number of bricks (up to 64) and paddle positions (up to 32) are small, so iterating through them in each step is efficient.
*   The number of simulation steps is bounded. In the worst case, if the ball bounces back and forth with a small velocity, there could be many steps. However, typical velocities and playfield size make this approach feasible within CodinGame's time limits. The "no corner hits" guarantee simplifies collision logic significantly.
