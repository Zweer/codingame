The problem asks us to determine if a driver can travel from a starting junction `s` to a destination junction `t` in a directed road network, adhering to specific time window constraints at certain junctions. The driver starts at `s` at time `0` and cannot wait at any junction; they must immediately proceed to an outgoing road.

This problem can be modeled as a search on an expanded state space. A state is defined by `(junction_id, arrival_time)`. Since we need to find *any* valid path, and not necessarily the shortest or fastest, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a suitable algorithm. The BFS will explore states layer by layer, ensuring that we find a path if one exists.

**State Definition:**
A state in our BFS will be `[junctionId, arrivalTime]`.

**Graph Representation:**
- **Junctions:** Numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
- **Roads:** Directed, with an associated duration. We'll use an adjacency list `adjList` where `adjList[u]` contains objects `{ to: v, duration: d }` for roads from `u` to `v` with duration `d`.
- **Time Windows:** Certain junctions have a time window `[b, e]`. The driver must arrive at such a junction at time `r` such that `b <= r <= e`. Junctions without a specified time window can be visited at any time. We'll store these in a `timeWindows` array/map.

**Constraints Analysis for `MAX_TIME_CONSIDERED`:**
- `n <= 10`: The maximum number of junctions is small.
- `m <= 20`: The maximum number of roads is also very small.
- `0 <= e - b < 10`: Time windows are narrow.
- `0 <= e, b <= 50`: Maximum end time for a time window is 50.
- `0 <= d <= 25`: Maximum duration for a single road is 25.

The crucial part for BFS is determining the maximum possible `arrivalTime` that needs to be tracked. If a junction has a time window `[b, e]`, `e` is at most 50. If a driver leaves a junction `u` at time `T_u` (which must be within `u`'s time window), and travels to `v` with duration `d`, they arrive at `v` at `T_v = T_u + d`.
In the worst case, a path could go through `n-1` roads. The maximum path duration without any time window constraints would be `(n-1) * max_d = (10-1) * 25 = 9 * 25 = 225`.
If a junction is required to be entered by time `e_max = 50`, and then the driver takes one more max-duration road (25), the final arrival time could be `50 + 25 = 75`.
To safely cover all possible relevant arrival times for the `visited` array size, we can use `MAX_TIME_CONSIDERED = E_MAX + (N_MAX - 1) * D_MAX = 50 + 225 = 275`. Rounding up to `300` provides a safe upper bound for the `visited` array's time dimension. This means the `visited` array will be `10 x 301`, which is small enough (`~3000` states).

**BFS Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create `adjList` and `timeWindows` arrays, pre-sizing them for `N_MAX`.
   - Create a `visited` 2D boolean array `visited[junction][time]`, initialized to `false`.
   - Initialize a queue for BFS with the starting state: `[s, 0]` (start junction `s`, time `0`).
   - Mark `visited[s][0] = true`.

2. **BFS Loop:**
   - While the `queue` is not empty:
     - Dequeue the `[currentJunction, currentArrivalTime]` state.
     - If `currentJunction` is equal to the `t` (destination), then a valid path has been found. Set `pathFound = true` and `break` the loop.
     - For each outgoing road `(currentJunction, nextJunction, travelDuration)`:
       - Calculate `nextArrivalTime = currentArrivalTime + travelDuration`.
       - **Time Window Check 1 (Upper Bound):** If `nextArrivalTime` is greater than `MAX_TIME_CONSIDERED`, skip this path segment as it leads to an irrelevant (or out-of-bounds for our array) state.
       - **Time Window Check 2 (Constraint Adherence):**
         - Get the time window for `nextJunction`: `[windowBegin, windowEnd]`. If `nextJunction` has no specific window, treat it as `[0, MAX_TIME_CONSIDERED]`.
         - If `nextArrivalTime` is NOT within `[windowBegin, windowEnd]` (i.e., `nextArrivalTime < windowBegin` or `nextArrivalTime > windowEnd`), then this path segment is invalid because the driver cannot wait or arrives too late. Skip it.
       - **Visited Check:** If the state `(nextJunction, nextArrivalTime)` has not been visited yet:
         - Mark `visited[nextJunction][nextArrivalTime] = true`.
         - Enqueue `[nextJunction, nextArrivalTime]`.

3. **Result:**
   - After the BFS loop finishes, print `true` if `pathFound` is `true`, otherwise print `false`.

**Code Structure:**
The solution will be a single TypeScript file. `readline()` and `print()` are assumed to be globally available as per CodinGame environment. A manual queue pointer (`head`) is used for efficiency instead of `Array.shift()`.
