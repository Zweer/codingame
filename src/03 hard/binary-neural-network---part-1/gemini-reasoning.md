The problem asks us to implement a binary neural network from scratch in TypeScript. This involves setting up the network topology, initializing weights using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), performing forward propagation, and training the network using backpropagation. Finally, we need to make predictions on test inputs.

Here's a breakdown of the implementation steps and the reasoning behind them:

1.  **LCG (Linear Congruential Generator):**
    *   The weights are initialized using a specific LCG. The formula is `X(n+1) = (A * X(n) + C) % M`, where `A=1103515245`, `C=12345`, `M=2^31` (0x80000000), and the initial seed `X(0)=1103527590`.
    *   A critical point is that the intermediate product `A * X(n)` can exceed JavaScript's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (which is `2^53 - 1`). To handle this, we must use `BigInt` for the LCG calculations, specifically for `currentSeed`, `A`, `C`, and `M`. The result of the modulo operation (`currentSeed`) will always be less than `2^31`, so it can be converted back to a `Number` for normalization (`/ 0x7fffffff`).

2.  **Network Structure (`NeuralNetwork` class):**
    *   **Nodes:** Each node is represented by an object with `id` (e.g., "I1", "H1:1", "O1"), `output` (the activation value `o`), `unnormalized_output` (the weighted sum of inputs `o'`), and `delta` (the error term `δ` for backpropagation).
    *   **Layers:** The network is structured as an array of arrays of nodes (`this.nodes[layerIdx][nodeIdx]`).
        *   `this.nodes[0]` holds input nodes.
        *   `this.nodes[1]` to `this.nodes[numHiddenLayers]` hold hidden nodes.
        *   `this.nodes[numHiddenLayers + 1]` holds output nodes.
    *   **Bias Node:** A special `biasNode` is defined, which always outputs `1`. It connects to all hidden and output nodes.
    *   **Weights:** Weights (`w[source, target]`) are stored in a `Map<string, number>`, where the key is a string combining the source and target node IDs (e.g., "I1\_H1:1"). This allows for easy lookup of any specific weight.

3.  **Weight Initialization (`initializeWeights`):**
    *   The problem specifies a strict order for weight initialization using the LCG:
        *   Iterate through target layers from left to right (from the first hidden layer or the output layer if no hidden layers).
        *   For each target layer, iterate through its nodes from top to bottom.
        *   For each target node, iterate through all nodes in the *previous* layer (from top to bottom), assigning a weight from the LCG.
        *   After assigning weights from all previous layer nodes, assign the bias weight for the current target node from the LCG.
    *   This order is meticulously followed to ensure correct weight values as per the LCG sequence.

4.  **Forward Pass (`forwardPass`):**
    *   Set the `output` of the input nodes to the provided input values.
    *   For each subsequent layer (hidden and output layers), calculate the `unnormalized_output` (`o'`) for each node:
        *   `o'[k] = sum(o[j] * w[j, k]) + o[θ] * w[θ, k]`
        *   `o[j]` are outputs from nodes in the *previous* layer.
        *   `o[θ]` is the bias node's output (always 1).
    *   Apply the sigmoid activation function: `o[k] = 1 / (1 + exp(-o'[k]))`.

5.  **Backpropagation (`backpropagation`):**
    *   This function calculates the error gradients (`δ`) and the weight changes (`Δw`), then applies them.
    *   **1. Calculate `δ` for Output Nodes:** For each output node `k`, `δ[k] = o[k] * (1 - o[k]) * (o[k] - tk)`. `tk` is the expected output.
    *   **2. Calculate `δ` for Hidden Nodes:** Iterate through hidden layers from right to left. For each hidden node `j`:
        *   `sum_delta_k_w_j_k = sum(δ[k] * w[j, k])` for all nodes `k` in the *next* layer to the right.
        *   `δ[j] = o[j] * (1 - o[j]) * (sum_delta_k_w_j_k)`.
    *   **3. Calculate `Δw` for all Links:**
        *   For a link `w[j, k]` (from source `j` to target `k`): `Δw = -η * δ[k] * o[j]`.
        *   For a bias link `w[θ, k]`: `Δw = -η * δ[k]` (since `o[θ]` is 1).
        *   It's crucial to store all `Δw` values temporarily in a `deltaWeights` map. This ensures that all `δ` calculations are based on current weights before any updates, preventing race conditions or incorrect gradient propagation.
    *   **4. Apply `Δw`:** After all `Δw` values are calculated, update the network's weights: `w = w + Δw`.

6.  **Training (`train`):**
    *   The training process involves repeating a cycle for `trainingIterations`:
        *   For each training example (`inputs`, `expectedOutputs`):
            *   Perform a `forwardPass` with `inputs`.
            *   Perform `backpropagation` using `expectedOutputs`.

7.  **Prediction (`predict`):**
    *   After training, for a given test input, perform a `forwardPass`.
    *   Return the outputs of the output nodes, rounded to the nearest integer (`Math.round`) as required for binary output.

**Input/Output Handling:**
*   The `readline` module is used to read input line by line in the CodinGame environment.
*   Input lines are parsed to extract network parameters, test inputs, and training data. Binary strings are converted to arrays of numbers.
*   Outputs are joined back into a binary string for printing.
