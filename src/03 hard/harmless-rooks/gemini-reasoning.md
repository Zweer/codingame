The puzzle asks us to find the maximum number of rooks that can be placed on a generalized `N x N` chessboard, where some squares are occupied ('X') and cannot be used, and rooks must not threaten each other. The rule for threatening is key: "two rooks on the same line/column must be separated by at least one occupied square".

This rule implies that if we have a continuous block of free squares ('.') in a row (e.g., `...`), only one rook can be placed within this block. If two rooks were placed in the same block, they would not be separated by an 'X'. Similarly, for a continuous block of free squares in a column, only one rook can be placed.

This interpretation transforms the problem into a classic Maximum Bipartite Matching problem.
1.  **Identify "segments"**: A segment is a maximal continuous block of free squares ('.') in a given row or column. For example, in `XX..X`, `..` is a horizontal segment. In `..X..`, the first `..` is a vertical segment, and the second `..` is another. Each such segment can accommodate at most one rook.
2.  **Construct a Bipartite Graph**:
    *   Create a set of nodes `U` representing all identified horizontal segments.
    *   Create a set of nodes `V` representing all identified vertical segments.
    *   Add an edge between a horizontal segment node `h` (from set `U`) and a vertical segment node `v` (from set `V`) if and only if they intersect at a free square on the board.
3.  **Maximum Matching**: Finding the maximum number of rooks is equivalent to finding the maximum matching in this bipartite graph. A matching is a set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex. If we select an edge `(h, v)`, it means we place a rook at the intersection of `h` and `v`. This uses up segment `h` and segment `v`, meaning no other rook can be placed in `h` or `v`. The size of the maximum matching is the maximum number of rooks.
4.  **Solve with Max Flow**: Maximum bipartite matching can be solved using a maximum flow algorithm.
    *   Create a source node `S` and a sink node `T`.
    *   Add an edge from `S` to each horizontal segment node `h_i` with capacity 1.
    *   Add an edge from each vertical segment node `v_j` to `T` with capacity 1.
    *   For every edge `(h_i, v_j)` identified in the bipartite graph (i.e., they intersect), add an edge from `h_i` to `v_j` with capacity 1.
    *   The maximum flow from `S` to `T` in this network will be the size of the maximum bipartite matching.

**Complexity Analysis**:
*   The board size `N` is up to 99.
*   The maximum number of horizontal segments (`numH`) in the worst case (e.g., `X.X.X` pattern) is `N * ceil(N/2)`, which is `O(N^2)`. Similarly for vertical segments (`numV`). So, `numH` and `numV` are `O(N^2)`.
*   The total number of nodes in the flow network is `S + T + numH + numV = O(N^2)`.
*   The number of edges in the flow network: `numH` (from S) + `numV` (to T) + `count_of_dots` (between H and V segments). `count_of_dots` is at most `N*N`, so total edges `E = O(N^2)`.
*   Edmonds-Karp algorithm with BFS for finding augmenting paths has a complexity of `O(F * (V + E))` for unit capacity networks, where `F` is the maximum flow, `V` is the number of nodes, and `E` is the number of edges.
    *   `F` is at most `min(numH, numV)`, so `O(N^2)`.
    *   `V = O(N^2)`.
    *   `E = O(N^2)`.
    *   Overall complexity: `O(N^2 * (N^2 + N^2)) = O(N^4)`.
*   For `N=99`, `N^4` is approximately `(100)^4 = 10^8`. This might be just acceptable within a 1-second time limit, especially if constants are small and the language/runtime is efficient. A common optimization for the BFS queue (using an array as a circular buffer or two pointers instead of `shift()`) is necessary in JavaScript/TypeScript for this complexity to hold.

The provided solution implements the Edmonds-Karp algorithm with an optimized queue for BFS.
