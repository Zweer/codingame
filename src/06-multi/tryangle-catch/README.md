This is a **league-based** challenge. 

Wood leagues should be considered as a tutorial which lets players discover the different rules of the game.   
In Bronze league all rules will be unlocked and the real challenge will begin.   
To have a look at the final rules, go [here](https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/843364c35de5a48f4e0de3a6e0720b74d11b1a) and switch leagues at the top right corner. 

# The Goal 

Collect more points than your opponent by capturing and defending triangles. 

# Rules 

The map consists of houses, some of which are connected by paths. Houses are defined by x and y coordinate. Each player starts with 3 units on one side of the map. Then the players try to capture a triangle by owning all three corner houses of it. They can use a triangle to spawn a new unit, kill all opponent units on a given house and add or remove a path between two houses.   
  
**Moving units**  
Units can be moved from a house to one of the direct neighbors each turn.   
  
**House ownership**  
A house is owned, when the player has strictly more units on it than the opponent player or when all neighboring houses are owned by that player.   
  
**Surrounded units**  
When a unit is surrounded by opponent houses, meaning each neighboring house is owned by the opponent, the unit is killed.   
  
**Triangles**  
A triangle is defined by three houses, that are all connected with each other. A triangle may not contain any other houses inside itself.  
After each turn the players get 1 point for each triangle they currently own.   
  
**Capturing a triangle**  
To capture a triangle, a player has to own all three corners of it and be eligible to claim the triangle. Initially the players can capture all triangles. This will only change after using them. A captured triangle will remain in the ownership of the player until it's used or captured by the opponent.   
  
**Using a triangle**  
When owning a triangle, a player can use it to perform one of the actions described below. This will make the triangle neutral again. The player using it can only capture it again after moving all units away from each house or after it got captured by the opponent player.   
  
  
**Spawning a unit**  
One way to use a triangle is to spawn a unit. This will place a unit on one house of the triangle. The player can choose the corner to spawn on. 

Victory Conditions

* You collect more points than your opponent
* You own at least 80% of all triangles

Loss Conditions

* You collect less points than your opponent
* You have no triangles and no units left
* Your opponent owns at least 80% of all triangles
* You do not respond in time or output an unrecognized command

The game turn works as follows: 
1. Move units
2. Spawn units
3. Kill surrounded units
4. Change ownership of triangles

## Game Input 

Initial input

First line: houseCount, the number of houses on the board   
Next houseCount lines: houseId houseX houseY, the id and location of each point 
  
  
Input for each game turn

First line: myScore opponentScore, the score points of you and your opponent respectively   
Next houseCount lines: houseId myUnits opponentUnits, the house ID and the amount of your own and opponent units on it   
Next line: pathCount, the number of paths   
Next pathCount lines: house1 house2indicating a connection between these two houses   
Next line: triangleCount, the number of triangles   
Next triangleCount lines: house1 house2 house3 owner meCanCapture opponentCanCapture.   
house1 house2 house3 give the corners of the triangle.   
owner indicating the owner of the triangle. It will be \-1 if it's neutral, 0 if it belongs to you and 1 if it belongs to your opponent.   
meCanCapture is 1 if you can currently capture it, 0 otherwise   
opponentCanCapture is 1 if your opponent can currently capture it, 0 otherwise   
Next line: linkableCount, the number of new paths that can possibly be created   
This value will always be 0 in lower leagues   
Next linkableCount lines: house1 house2 giving the houses that can be linked.   
  
Output for one game turn

You can print an arbitrary amount of commands per turn, separated by ; 
* MOVE from to amountmove amount units from house from to house to. If there is no direct connection between these two houses, the units will move closer along a shortest path if possible or stay if there is no path.
* SPAWN house1 house2 house3to spawn a unit on house1 using the given triangle. Change the house order to affect the spawning location

Constraints 

houseCount ≤ 50   
0 ≤ houseX < 1920   
0 ≤ houseY < 1080   
  
  
 Response time first turn ≤ 1000 ms   
 Response time per turn ≤ 50 ms   
 The game ends after 200 turns
