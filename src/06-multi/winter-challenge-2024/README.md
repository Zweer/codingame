This is a **league based** challenge. 

For this challenge, multiple leagues for the same game are available. Once you have proven your skills against the first Boss, you will access a higher league and extra rules will be available.   
  
**NEW:** In low leagues, your submission will only fight the boss in the arena. Win a best-of-five to advance. 

## Goal 

Grow your organism to become the largest!

## Rules 

The game is played on a grid.  
  
For the lower leagues, you need only beat the Boss in specific situations. 

  
### 🔵🔴 The Organisms

**Organisms** are made up of **organs** that take up one tile of space on the game grid.

  
Each player starts with a ROOT type organ. In this league, your organism can GROW a new BASIC type organ on each turn in order to cover a larger area.

  
A new organ can grow **from** any existing **organ**, onto an **empty adjacent location**.

  
 In order to GROW, your organism needs **proteins**.

 In this league, you start with 10 proteins of type A. Growing 1 BASIC organ requires 1 of these proteins. 

  
You can obtain more **proteins** by growing an organ onto a tile of the grid containing a **protein source**, these are tiles with a letter in them. Doing so will grant you 3 proteins of the corresponding type. 

  
**Grow more organs than the Boss to advance to the next league.** 

  
You organism can receive the following command:

* GROW id x y type: creates a new organ at location x, y from organ with id id. If the target location is not a neighbour of id, the organ will be created on the shortest path to x, y.

_This command will create new BASIC organ with the ROOT organ as its parent._
  
See the **Game Protocol** section for more information on sending commands to your organism.
  
  
### ⛔ Game end

The game stops when it detects progress can no longer be made or after 100 turns.  
  
Victory Conditions

The winner is the player with the most tiles occupied by one of their organs. 

Defeat Conditions

Your program does not provide a command in the alloted time or one of the commands is invalid. 

  
### 🐞 Debugging tips

* Hover over the grid to see extra information on the organ under your mouse.
* Append text after any command and that text will appear above your organism.
* Press the gear icon on the viewer to access extra display options.
* Use the keyboard to control the action: space to play/pause, arrows to step 1 frame at a time.

## Game Protocol 

Initialization Input

First line: two integers width and height for the size of the grid.  

Input for One Game Turn

First line: one integer entityCount for the number of entities on the grid.  
Next entityCount lines: the following 7 inputs for each entity: 
* x: X coordinate (0 is leftmost)
* y: Y coordinate (0 is topmost)
* type:  
  * WALL for a wall
  * ROOT for a ROOT type organ
  * BASIC for a BASIC type organ
  * A for an A protein source
* owner:  
  * 1 if you are the owner of this organ
  * 0 if your opponent owns this organ
  * \-1 if this is not an organ
* organId: unique id of this entity if it is an organ, 0 otherwise
* organDir: N, W, S, or E, not used in this league
* organParentId: if it is an organ, the organId of the organ that this organ grew from (0 for ROOT organs), else 0.
* organRootId: if it is an organ, the organId of the ROOT that this organ originally grew from, else 0.
Next line: 4 integers: myA,myB,myC,myD for the amount of each protein type you have.   
Next line: 4 integers: oppA,oppB,oppC,oppD for the amount of each protein type your opponent has.   
Next line: the integer requiredActionsCount which equals 1 _in this league_. 

Output

A single line with your action:

What is in store for me in the higher leagues? 

The extra rules available in higher leagues are:
* An organ type to gather more proteins
* An organ type to attack your opponent
* An organ type to spawn more organisms
