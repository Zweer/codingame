The puzzle asks us to implement a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system to detect offside situations in a simplified football (soccer) pitch.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Pitch and Coordinate System:**
    *   The pitch is a grid of `WIDTH = 51` columns (X-coordinates from 0 to 50) and `HEIGHT = 15` rows (Y-coordinates from 0 to 14).
    *   The half-way line is at `X = 25`.
    *   `TEAM_A` attacks from right to left (towards `X=0`). Their half is `25 <= X <= 50`.
    *   `TEAM_B` attacks from left to right (towards `X=50`). Their half is `0 <= X <= 25`.

2.  **Input Parsing:**
    *   We read 15 lines, each 51 characters long.
    *   We iterate through each character to identify players (`a`, `b`, `A`, `B`) and the ball (`o`, `O`).
    *   Players are stored with their coordinates (`x`, `y`), team (`A` or `B`), and active status (`true` for `A`/`B`, `false` for `a`/`b`).
    *   The ball is stored with its coordinates and the `releasingTeam` (`A` for `o`, `B` for `O`).

3.  **Determining Attacking/Opponent Teams:**
    *   The `attackingTeam` is the `releasingTeam` of the ball.
    *   The `opponentTeam` is the other team.

4.  **Checking for Throw-in:**
    *   An offside position is not possible if the ball is released from a throw-in.
    *   A throw-in occurs if the ball's Y-coordinate is `0` (first row) or `14` (last row).

5.  **Calculating the Second Last Opponent (SLO) Position:**
    *   The offside rule states a player must be "nearer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent".
    *   The "second last opponent" refers to the second player of the *defending team* closest to their own goal line, from the perspective of the attacking team.
    *   **If `TEAM_A` is attacking (goal at X=0):** `TEAM_B` is defending. Their goal is at X=0. The second last opponent (of `TEAM_B`) is the player with the second *lowest* X coordinate among all `TEAM_B` players. This is because smaller X values are closer to their goal.
    *   **If `TEAM_B` is attacking (goal at X=50):** `TEAM_A` is defending. Their goal is at X=50. The second last opponent (of `TEAM_A`) is the player with the second *highest* X coordinate among all `TEAM_A` players. This is because larger X values are closer to their goal.
    *   **Edge cases for SLO:**
        *   If there are no opponent players, offside is effectively impossible for this rule, so `secondLastOpponentX` is set to an extreme value outside the pitch bounds (`-1` for `TEAM_A` attacking, `WIDTH` for `TEAM_B` attacking).
        *   If there is only one opponent player, the "second last opponent" is considered to be the goal line itself (`0` for `TEAM_A` attacking, `WIDTH - 1` for `TEAM_B` attacking).

6.  **Identifying Players in an Offside Position:**
    *   We iterate through all players belonging to the `attackingTeam`.
    *   For each attacking player, we check three conditions:
        1.  **In Opponent's Half:**
            *   For `TEAM_A` attacking, the player must be in `0 <= X <= 25` (i.e., `player.x <= HALF_WAY_LINE_X`).
            *   For `TEAM_B` attacking, the player must be in `26 <= X <= 50` (i.e., `player.x > HALF_WAY_LINE_X`).
        2.  **Nearer than Ball:** The player must be closer to the opponent's goal line than the ball.
            *   For `TEAM_A` attacking (goal at `X=0`), `player.x < ball.x`.
            *   For `TEAM_B` attacking (goal at `X=50`), `player.x > ball.x`.
        3.  **Nearer than Second Last Opponent (SLO):** The player must be closer to the opponent's goal line than the `secondLastOpponentX`.
            *   For `TEAM_A` attacking (goal at `X=0`), `player.x < secondLastOpponentX`.
            *   For `TEAM_B` attacking (goal at `X=50`), `player.x > secondLastOpponentX`.
    *   If all three conditions are met, the player is in an offside position. We increment a counter (`playersInOffsidePositionCount`).
    *   If any player in an offside position is also "actively involved" (character `A` or `B`), we set a flag `offsideOffenceCommitted` to `true`.

7.  **Output:**
    *   Line 1: Print the number of players in an offside position.
    *   Line 2: Print "VAR: OFFSIDE!" if an `offsideOffenceCommitted` is true AND it's not a `isThrowIn`. Otherwise, print "VAR: ONSIDE!".
