## Reasoning

The problem asks us to validate whether an expression consisting solely of various types of brackets (`()`, `[]`, `{}`) is correctly paired and nested. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using a stack data structure.

Here's the logic:

1.  **Initialize a Stack:** We'll use a stack (a simple array in TypeScript, using `push` and `pop`) to keep track of opening brackets as we encounter them.

2.  **Define Bracket Types:**
    *   Create a `Set` for `openingBrackets` (`(`, `[`, `{`) to quickly check if a character is an opening bracket.
    *   Create a `Map` for `matchingBrackets` that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket (e.g., `')'` maps to `'('`, `']'` maps to `'['`, `'}'` maps to `'{'`). This allows us to quickly verify if a closing bracket matches the last opened bracket.

3.  **Iterate Through the Expression:** Process the input `expression` character by character.

    *   **If an Opening Bracket:** If the current character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, or `{`), push it onto the stack. This signifies that we've encountered an opening bracket that is waiting for its corresponding closing bracket.

    *   **If a Closing Bracket:** If the current character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, or `}`):
        *   **Check for Empty Stack:** First, check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means we've encountered a closing bracket without any corresponding opening bracket (e.g., `)abc`). In this case, the expression is immediately invalid, and we can output `false` and terminate.
        *   **Pop from Stack:** If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack. This element represents the most recently opened, unclosed bracket.
        *   **Check for Match:** Compare the popped opening bracket with the expected opening bracket for the current closing character (using our `matchingBrackets` map). If they don't match (e.g., `([)]`), the brackets are mismatched, and the expression is invalid. Output `false` and terminate.

4.  **After Iteration:** Once all characters in the expression have been processed:
    *   **Empty Stack:** If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket found its corresponding closing bracket, and all nesting was correct. The expression is valid, so output `true`.
    *   **Non-Empty Stack:** If the stack is not empty, it means there are unclosed opening brackets (e.g., `({)`). The expression is invalid, so output `false`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `expression`. We iterate through the string once, and each stack operation (push, pop, check length) and Set/Map lookup takes O(1) time on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case (e.g., an expression like `(((((`), where the stack could store up to N/2 opening brackets.

This approach covers all conditions for valid bracket pairing and nesting, making it robust for the given problem constraints.
