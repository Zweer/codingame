The problem asks us to find the path from the root of a binary tree to a given target node `V`. The tree nodes are identified by unique integer indices. Each internal node has exactly two children, and leaf nodes have zero children. We need to output the path as a sequence of "Left" and "Right" commands. If the target node is the root itself, we should print "Root".

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Tree Representation:** We are given `M` lines, each specifying a parent `P` and its left `L` and right `R` children. This information allows us to construct the tree structure. A good way to represent the tree is to use a `Map` where keys are node indices and values are objects representing each node. Each node object should store its `left` child, `right` child, and crucially, its `parent`. To determine if a node is a "Left" or "Right" child of its parent, we can also store a `isLeftChild` boolean flag.

    
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \ / \
 4   5 9  8
           / \
          6   7
```

Target `V = 5`.
1.  Initialize `path = []`.
2.  `currentNode = nodes.get(5)`.
    *   `nodes.get(5).parent` is `2`.
    *   `nodes.get(5).isLeftChild` is `false` (meaning it's a right child).
    *   `path.push("Right")`. `path = ["Right"]`.
    *   `currentNode = nodes.get(2)`.
3.  `currentNode = nodes.get(2)`.
    *   `nodes.get(2).parent` is `1`.
    *   `nodes.get(2).isLeftChild` is `true` (meaning it's a left child).
    *   `path.push("Left")`. `path = ["Right", "Left"]`.
    *   `currentNode = nodes.get(1)`.
4.  `currentNode = nodes.get(1)` (which is the root).
    *   `nodes.get(1).parent` is `null`. The loop terminates.
5.  `path.reverse()`. `path` becomes `["Left", "Right"]`.
6.  `path.join(" ")` results in `"Left Right"`.

This matches the expected output. The constraints (`N < 128`) are small, so this approach will be very efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
