The problem asks us to simulate a modified dart game called "The Dart 101" for multiple players and determine the winner. The winner is the player who reaches exactly 101 points in the fewest number of rounds.

Here's a breakdown of the game rules and how they are implemented:

1.  **Objective:** Score exactly 101 points.
2.  **Rounds:** Each player throws up to 3 darts per round. A round can end early if:
    *   The player reaches exactly 101 points (wins the game).
    *   The player exceeds 101 points (score reverts to before the current round, and the round ends).
    *   The player misses 3 times in the same round (total score resets to 0, and the round ends).
3.  **Scoring Darts:**
    *   A number (e.g., `19`): Adds that number to the round's score.
    *   `2*N`: Adds `2 * N` to the round's score.
    *   `3*N`: Adds `3 * N` to the round's score.
4.  **Missing (`X`):**
    *   Each `X` reduces the current round's score by 20 points.
    *   **Consecutive Misses:** If a player misses twice consecutively *in the same round*, an *additional* 10 points are deducted (making the second consecutive miss effectively -30 for that dart, resulting in -50 for the two consecutive misses in total for the round). The `consecutiveMissesInRound` counter tracks this and resets on a successful hit.
    *   **Three Misses:** If a player misses three times *in the same round*, their *total game score* is immediately reset to 0, and the current round ends.
5.  **Score Updates:**
    *   Points (positive or negative) from darts are accumulated in a `roundScoreAccumulator`.
    *   After each dart, the `potentialTotalScore` (calculated as `scoreBeforeThisRound + roundScoreAccumulator`) is checked:
        *   If `potentialTotalScore` is exactly 101, the player wins, their `totalScore` is set to 101, and the simulation for this player ends.
        *   If `potentialTotalScore` is greater than 101, the player's `totalScore` reverts to `scoreBeforeThisRound` (the score they had *before* the current round began), and the current round ends immediately.
    *   If a round completes all 3 darts normally (without hitting/exceeding 101 or 3 misses), the `roundScoreAccumulator` is added to the `totalScore`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Read Input:**
    *   Read `N`, the number of players.
    *   Read `N` player names and store them.
    *   Read `N` lines of player shoots (space-separated strings) and store them.
2.  **Simulate Each Player:**
    *   For each player, call a `simulatePlayer` function.
    *   Inside `simulatePlayer`:
        *   Initialize `totalScore = 0`, `roundsPlayed = 0`, and `currentShootIndex = 0`.
        *   Start a `while` loop that continues as long as `totalScore` is not 101 and there are still darts left for the player.
        *   Inside the `while` loop (representing a round):
            *   Increment `roundsPlayed`.
            *   Initialize `roundScoreAccumulator = 0`, `consecutiveMissesInRound = 0`, `missesCountInRound = 0`.
            *   Store `scoreBeforeThisRound` (current `totalScore`).
            *   Use a flag `roundEndedEarlyDueToSpecialCondition` to track if the round was cut short by a reset or revert.
            *   Start a `for` loop for up to 3 darts.
                *   Parse the dart string: If `X`, apply miss rules. If `N`, `2*N`, `3*N`, calculate value and add to `roundScoreAccumulator`.
                *   After each dart, calculate `potentialTotalScore = scoreBeforeThisRound + roundScoreAccumulator`.
                *   Check `potentialTotalScore` for 101 (win) or >101 (revert). If either, set the `totalScore` accordingly, set `roundEndedEarlyDueToSpecialCondition = true`, and `break` from the inner `for` loop.
                *   If 3 misses occurred, set `totalScore = 0`, set `roundEndedEarlyDueToSpecialCondition = true`, and `break` from the inner `for` loop.
            *   After the `for` loop: If `roundEndedEarlyDueToSpecialCondition` is `false`, it means the round completed normally, so `totalScore = scoreBeforeThisRound + roundScoreAccumulator`.
        *   The `simulatePlayer` function returns the `roundsPlayed` and `totalScore` for that player.
3.  **Determine Winner:**
    *   Initialize `winnerName = null` and `minRounds = Infinity`.
    *   After simulating each player, if their `result.score` is 101:
        *   Compare their `result.rounds` with `minRounds`.
        *   If `result.rounds` is less than `minRounds`, update `minRounds` and set `winnerName` to the current player's name.
4.  **Print Output:**
    *   Print the `winnerName`.

This approach ensures that all game rules, including the subtle interactions of consecutive misses, score reverts, and resets, are handled correctly for each player, leading to the identification of the player who wins in the fewest rounds.
