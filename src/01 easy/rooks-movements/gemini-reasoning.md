The puzzle asks us to calculate all possible moves for a white rook on an 8x8 chessboard, given its starting position and the positions and colors of other pieces.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Chessboard Representation:**
    *   The standard algebraic notation (`a1` to `h8`) needs to be mapped to a 0-indexed 2D array for easier manipulation.
    *   We'll use a `[row, col]` coordinate system where `[0,0]` corresponds to `a8` (top-left) and `[7,7]` corresponds to `h1` (bottom-right).
        *   Columns 'a' through 'h' map to indices 0 through 7.
        *   Rows '8' through '1' map to indices 0 through 7. (i.e., row '8' is index 0, row '1' is index 7).
    *   Helper functions are created for these conversions (`algebraicToCoords`, `coordsToAlgebraic`, `colCharToIndex`, `rowNumToIndex`, etc.).
    *   The board itself will be a 2D array `board[8][8]`, storing `null` for an empty square, `0` for a white piece, and `1` for a black piece.

2.  **Board Initialization:**
    *   First, initialize the entire `board` with `null` values.
    *   Read the rook's starting position and place a `WHITE` piece (`0`) at its corresponding coordinates on the board.
    *   Read the number of other pieces (`P`).
    *   For each of the `P` pieces, read its color and position, then place it on the board. If an "other piece" occupies the same square as the rook, it will overwrite the rook's presence, but this shouldn't happen in valid chess scenarios and doesn't affect the blocking logic significantly as the rook's *actual* starting position is known.

3.  **Rook Movement Logic:**
    *   A rook moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
    *   We define four directions: up, down, left, and right.
    *   For each direction, we iterate step-by-step outwards from the rook's starting position:
        *   Calculate the `targetRow` and `targetCol` for the current step.
        *   **Boundary Check:** If `targetRow` or `targetCol` falls outside the 8x8 board, stop moving in this direction.
        *   **Piece Check:**
            *   If the `target` square is empty (`null`): The rook can move here. Add the move (`R<from_pos>-<to_pos>`) to our list of possible moves. Continue to the next step in this direction.
            *   If the `target` square contains a `BLACK` piece (`1`): The rook can capture this piece. Add the capture move (`R<from_pos>x<to_pos>`) to our list. After a capture, a rook cannot move past the captured piece, so stop exploring in this direction.
            *   If the `target` square contains a `WHITE` piece (`0`): The rook is blocked by an ally. It cannot move to or past this square. Stop exploring in this direction.

4.  **Output Formatting:**
    *   Collect all valid moves into an array.
    *   Sort this array lexicographically (ASCII order) as required by the puzzle.
    *   Join the sorted moves with spaces and print the result.

**Example Walkthrough (d5, 2, 0 c1, 1 e8):**

*   Rook at `d5` -> `[3,3]` (row 3, col 3)
*   White piece at `c1` -> `[7,2]`
*   Black piece at `e8` -> `[0,4]`

Board will have: `board[3][3]=0`, `board[7][2]=0`, `board[0][4]=1`. All other cells are `null`.

1.  **Up (dr=-1, dc=0) from `[3,3]`:**
    *   `[2,3]` (d6): Empty. Add `Rd5-d6`.
    *   `[1,3]` (d7): Empty. Add `Rd5-d7`.
    *   `[0,3]` (d8): Empty. Add `Rd5-d8`.
    *   `[-1,3]`: Out of bounds. Stop.
2.  **Down (dr=1, dc=0) from `[3,3]`:**
    *   `[4,3]` (d4): Empty. Add `Rd5-d4`.
    *   `[5,3]` (d3): Empty. Add `Rd5-d3`.
    *   `[6,3]` (d2): Empty. Add `Rd5-d2`.
    *   `[7,3]` (d1): Empty. Add `Rd5-d1`. (Note: `c1` is at `[7,2]`, not in this path)
    *   `[8,3]`: Out of bounds. Stop.
3.  **Left (dr=0, dc=-1) from `[3,3]`:**
    *   `[3,2]` (c5): Empty. Add `Rd5-c5`.
    *   `[3,1]` (b5): Empty. Add `Rd5-b5`.
    *   `[3,0]` (a5): Empty. Add `Rd5-a5`.
    *   `[3,-1]`: Out of bounds. Stop.
4.  **Right (dr=0, dc=1) from `[3,3]`:**
    *   `[3,4]` (e5): Empty. Add `Rd5-e5`.
    *   `[3,5]` (f5): Empty. Add `Rd5-f5`.
    *   `[3,6]` (g5): Empty. Add `Rd5-g5`.
    *   `[3,7]` (h5): Empty. Add `Rd5-h5`.
    *   `[3,8]`: Out of bounds. Stop.

All generated moves match the example output when sorted.
