The puzzle asks us to simulate a Clash of Code timer, which adjusts its final start time based on players joining the room. The timer starts at 5:00 and counts down.

Here's a breakdown of the rules and how they are implemented:

1.  **Initial State**: The timer starts at 5:00 (300 seconds). There is 1 player in the room (the host). The game is initially set to start when the timer reaches 0:00.

2.  **Player Join Event**:
    *   When a player joins, the current time displayed on the timer (`t`) and the number of players (`p`) are used to recalculate the game's start time.
    *   The formula given is `t - 256 / (2^(p - 1))`.
    *   A crucial step is understanding `p` in this formula. By carefully tracing the provided example, it becomes clear that `p` refers to the *ordinal number of the player joining the room*, *excluding the initial host*.
        *   When the 2nd player *overall* joins (i.e., the 1st player from the input list), `p` in the formula should be 1. The adjustment is `256 / (2^(1-1)) = 256 / 1 = 256`.
        *   When the 3rd player *overall* joins (i.e., the 2nd player from the input list), `p` in the formula should be 2. The adjustment is `256 / (2^(2-1)) = 256 / 2 = 128`.
        *   And so on.
    *   The result of this calculation (`new_start_time`) is the new target time on the timer at which the game will start.
    *   **Rule**: "If the result is under 0:00, set it to 0:00." This means we take `Math.max(0, new_start_time)`.

3.  **Simultaneous Join**: "If a player joins at the same time the game is supposed to start, set the new time instead of starting the game." This implies that processing player join events always takes precedence. We calculate and update the `final_start_time_on_timer` for each join event, and the game only "starts" after all input events are processed or if the room fills up.

4.  **Game Start Conditions**:
    *   The primary condition is that the timer reaches the `final_start_time_on_timer` calculated after all player join events have been processed.
    *   "The timer reaches zero and there is more than one player" is covered by the `final_start_time_on_timer` being set to 0.
    *   "The clash room is filled (8 players in total, 7 have joined)": If `n` is 7, the 7th player joining will make the total players 8. The game starts, and its start time will be the `final_start_time_on_timer` calculated for this last join event.

5.  **Output**:
    *   If `n` is 0 (no players joined beyond the host), output "NO GAME".
    *   Otherwise, output the `final_start_time_on_timer` in `m:ss` format.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  Read the integer `n`.
2.  If `n` is 0, print "NO GAME" and exit.
3.  Initialize:
    *   `numPlayersTotal = 1` (for the host).
    *   `finalStartTimerValueSeconds = 0` (initial game start time).
    *   `k_player_join_count = 0` (tracks how many players from the input have joined so far).
    *   Read all `n` join timestamps and convert them to seconds, storing them in an array.
4.  Iterate through the stored join timestamps:
    *   Increment `k_player_join_count` (this is our `p` for the formula).
    *   Increment `numPlayersTotal`.
    *   Let `t` be the current join timestamp (in seconds).
    *   Calculate `adjustment = 256 / (2**(k_player_join_count - 1))`.
    *   Calculate `newTargetTime = t - adjustment`.
    *   Update `finalStartTimerValueSeconds = Math.max(0, newTargetTime)`.
5.  After processing all join events, convert `finalStartTimerValueSeconds` back to `m:ss` format and print it.

**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**
Input:
3
4:47
3:56
3:13

Initial: `numPlayersTotal = 1`, `finalStartTimerValueSeconds = 0` (0:00), `k_player_join_count = 0`.

1.  **Player joins at 4:47 (287 seconds)**:
    *   `k_player_join_count` becomes 1. `numPlayersTotal` becomes 2.
    *   `t = 287`. `p` in formula is 1.
    *   `adjustment = 256 / (2^(1-1)) = 256 / 1 = 256`.
    *   `newTargetTime = 287 - 256 = 31`.
    *   `finalStartTimerValueSeconds = Math.max(0, 31) = 31` (0:31).

2.  **Player joins at 3:56 (236 seconds)**:
    *   `k_player_join_count` becomes 2. `numPlayersTotal` becomes 3.
    *   `t = 236`. `p` in formula is 2.
    *   `adjustment = 256 / (2^(2-1)) = 256 / 2 = 128`.
    *   `newTargetTime = 236 - 128 = 108`.
    *   `finalStartTimerValueSeconds = Math.max(0, 108) = 108` (1:48).

3.  **Player joins at 3:13 (193 seconds)**:
    *   `k_player_join_count` becomes 3. `numPlayersTotal` becomes 4.
    *   `t = 193`. `p` in formula is 3.
    *   `adjustment = 256 / (2^(3-1)) = 256 / 4 = 64`.
    *   `newTargetTime = 193 - 64 = 129`.
    *   `finalStartTimerValueSeconds = Math.max(0, 129) = 129` (2:09).

All join events processed. The final `finalStartTimerValueSeconds` is 129.
Output: 2:09. This matches the example.
