The problem asks us to simulate the impact of shockwaves from different types of bombs on a square grid and report the maximum intensity felt at each cell. The grid can contain initial numeric intensities (from previous effects) or bomb characters ('A', 'H', 'B'). A key rule is that bomb locations themselves are *not* replaced by numbers in the final output; they retain their original character. B-bombs have a special condition: they only explode if their location is already within a shockwave (i.e., has an intensity greater than 0 from other bomb effects or initial grid values).

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Grid Initialization**:
    *   We need two grids: `initialGrid` to store the original characters (important for preserving bomb locations in the output) and `intensityGrid` to store the numeric shockwave intensities.
    *   `intensityGrid` is initialized by parsing numeric characters from the input grid. For cells containing 'A', 'H', or 'B' (bombs), their corresponding `intensityGrid` cell is initialized to 0, and their coordinates and type are stored in a `bombList`.

2.  **Bomb Explosion Logic (`applyBombEffect` function)**:
    *   This function takes bomb coordinates `(bombR, bombC)` and its `type` as input.
    *   It iterates through a square region around the bomb (max radius 4, derived from B-bomb's maximum vertical reach).
    *   For each cell `(currentR, currentC)` within this region and grid boundaries, it calculates the `newIntensity` based on the bomb's type and the relative position `(dr, dc)`:
        *   **A-bomb**: Intensity is `4 - d`, where `d` is the Chebyshev distance (`Math.max(Math.abs(dr), Math.abs(dc))`). Valid for `d` from 1 to 3.
        *   **H-bomb**: Constant intensity of 5. Valid for `d` (Chebyshev distance) from 1 to 3.
        *   **B-bomb**: This bomb has a unique cross-shaped pattern with specific intensities for horizontal and vertical arms:
            *   Horizontal arm (`dr === 0`, `dc !== 0`):
                *   Distance 1 (`abs(dc) = 1`): Intensity 3
                *   Distance 2 (`abs(dc) = 2`): Intensity 2
                *   Distance 3 (`abs(dc) = 3`): Intensity 1
            *   Vertical arm (`dc === 0`, `dr !== 0`):
                *   Distance 1 (`abs(dr) = 1`): Intensity 3
                *   Distance 2 (`abs(dr) = 2`): Intensity 3 (Note: different from horizontal arm)
                *   Distance 3 (`abs(dr) = 3`): Intensity 2
                *   Distance 4 (`abs(dr) = 4`): Intensity 1
            *   Diagonal cells (`dr !== 0 && dc !== 0`) are not affected by B-bombs.
        *   **Bomb Center**: The problem states "the bomb's location is not replaced by a number". This implies that a bomb *itself* does not impart a numeric intensity to its own cell. This is handled implicitly by the pattern definitions (e.g., A-bomb pattern for `d=0` is 'A', not a number). In `applyBombEffect`, `newIntensity` is initialized to 0, and only updated if a specific non-zero effect applies based on distance, so the bomb's own center remains 0 effectively.
    *   The `intensityGrid[currentR][currentC]` is updated with `Math.max(currentIntensity, newIntensity)` to ensure we always store the strongest effect.

3.  **Bomb Processing Phases**:

    *   **Phase 1: A and H Bombs**: These bombs explode unconditionally. We iterate through all 'A' and 'H' bombs found and call `applyBombEffect` for each. This populates the `intensityGrid` with their shockwaves.

    *   **Phase 2: B Bombs (Iterative for Chain Reactions)**:
        *   B-bombs only explode if their location in `intensityGrid` has an intensity greater than 0 (meaning it's affected by an A-bomb, H-bomb, a previously exploded B-bomb, or an initial non-zero value).
        *   This requires an iterative approach, as one B-bomb exploding could trigger another.
        *   We maintain a `bombsToProcessThisIteration` list and a `explodedBBombs` set.
        *   The loop continues as long as `anyBombExplodedInIteration` is true. In each iteration:
            *   We check each B-bomb in `bombsToProcessThisIteration`.
            *   If its `intensityGrid` value is `> 0` and it hasn't exploded yet, it explodes: `applyBombEffect` is called, it's added to `explodedBBombs`, and `anyBombExplodedInIteration` is set to true.
            *   If it doesn't explode, it's moved to `nextBombsToProcess` for the next iteration.
            *   If no bombs explode in an iteration, the chain reaction stops.

4.  **Output Generation**:
    *   Finally, iterate through the grid.
    *   For each cell `(i, j)`:
        *   If `initialGrid[i][j]` contained 'A', 'H', or 'B', print the original character.
        *   Otherwise (it was a numeric cell), print the `intensityGrid[i][j]` value.

This approach ensures that all bomb types are handled correctly, chain reactions for B-bombs are simulated, and the output format respects the bomb character preservation rule. The `maxEffectiveRadius` is chosen to cover the largest possible impact range of any bomb type.
