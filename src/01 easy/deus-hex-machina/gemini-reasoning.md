The puzzle "deus Hex machina" asks us to apply a sequence of horizontal and/or vertical flips to a given hexadecimal number. The sequence of flips is determined by the binary representation of the input hexadecimal number: '0' for horizontal, '1' for vertical. Each flip is applied digit by digit. If any digit becomes an invalid hex digit (represented by '#'), the result is "Not a number". The output should be capped at 1000 hex digits.

The most critical part of this puzzle is correctly determining the mapping rules for horizontal and vertical flips for each hexadecimal digit (0-F). The problem description provides two sources of information, which unfortunately seem contradictory:
1.  **A large illustrative example**: "Below is how 123456789abcdef0 looks like after one flip: Horizontal flip: 123456789abcdef0 | 0#9b#d6e8#a2##51" and "Vertical flip: 153#2e#8a9#c#6#0". This provides mappings for all 16 hexadecimal digits.
2.  **A detailed step-by-step example for input `15`**: This example shows `15` transforming to `12` after a vertical flip, `12` transforming to `15` after a horizontal flip, and so on, following the binary sequence `10101`.

**Contradiction Analysis:**
If we derive the flip maps directly from the `123456789abcdef0` banner, we get:
*   `H_MAP['1'] = '0'`
*   `H_MAP['2'] = '#'`
*   `H_MAP['5'] = '#'`
*   `V_MAP['1'] = '1'`
*   `V_MAP['2'] = '5'`
*   `V_MAP['5'] = '2'`

However, the `15` example's trace implies different mappings for some digits:
*   `15` (Vertical flip) -> `12`: Implies `V_MAP['1'] = '1'` and `V_MAP['5'] = '2'`. (These are consistent with the banner's `V_MAP`).
*   `12` (Horizontal flip) -> `15`: Implies `H_MAP['1'] = '1'` and `H_MAP['2'] = '5'`. (These *contradict* the banner's `H_MAP`, where `H['1']='0'` and `H['2']='#'`).

When faced with contradictory specifications in CodinGame puzzles, the most reliable approach is usually to prioritize the most comprehensive and direct definition, or the one that leads to a consistent, non-contradictory set of rules across all involved elements. The banner's definition covers all 16 hex digits explicitly. Attempting to reconcile the `15` example's implicit mappings with the banner's explicit mappings creates further contradictions (`H_MAP['1']` would need to be `0` from the banner, `1` from the `15` example, and `5` if `15`'s H-flip to `51` was also taken into account as a *definition*).

Therefore, the most robust interpretation is that the `123456789abcdef0` banner text provides the **definitive and universal flip maps** for all digits. The `15` example, if its trace's intermediate results do not match these maps, either implies additional, unstated transformations, or (more likely for competitive programming) contains illustrative values that are not strictly consistent with the universal maps. The provided example output `12` for input `15` can only be achieved if specific rules override the banner-derived maps. However, without a clear rule for such overrides, the most straightforward interpretation is to use the comprehensive tables.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Define Flip Maps**: Create two lookup tables (`H_MAP` and `V_MAP`) based *strictly* on the `123456789abcdef0` example from the problem description.
    *   **Horizontal Map (H_MAP)**:
        `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0`, `2 -> #`, `3 -> 9`, `4 -> b`, `5 -> #`, `6 -> d`, `7 -> 6`,
        `8 -> e`, `9 -> 8`, `a -> #`, `b -> a`, `c -> 2`, `d -> #`, `e -> #`, `f -> 5`
    *   **Vertical Map (V_MAP)**:
        `0 -> 0`, `1 -> 1`, `2 -> 5`, `3 -> 3`, `4 -> #`, `5 -> 2`, `6 -> #`, `7 -> 8`,
        `8 -> a`, `9 -> 9`, `a -> #`, `b -> c`, `c -> #`, `d -> 6`, `e -> #`, `f -> #`

2.  **Convert Hex to Binary Instructions**: The input hexadecimal number is converted to its binary string representation. This string will be the sequence of flip instructions. For large hexadecimal numbers (up to 10000 digits), `BigInt` must be used for conversion (`BigInt("0x" + N).toString(2)`). Leading zeros in the input hex number (e.g., `015`) result in the same binary string as the non-leading-zero version (`15` -> `10101`), which is consistent with "number itself, but expressed in binary".

3.  **Apply Flips Iteratively**:
    *   Initialize `currentNumber` with the input hexadecimal string.
    *   Initialize a boolean `isNotANumber` to `false`.
    *   Iterate through each character (`'0'` or `'1'`) in the `binaryInstructions` string:
        *   If `isNotANumber` is already `true`, break the loop immediately.
        *   Determine which map to use (`H_MAP` for '0', `V_MAP` for '1').
        *   Create a new string by mapping each character in `currentNumber` using the chosen map.
        *   If any digit maps to `'#'`, set `isNotANumber` to `true` and break from the inner digit-mapping loop.
        *   Update `currentNumber` with the new flipped string.

4.  **Output Result**:
    *   If `isNotANumber` is `true`, print "Not a number".
    *   Otherwise, print `currentNumber`. If `currentNumber` exceeds 1000 digits, print only the first 1000 digits using `substring(0, 1000)`.

This approach consistently applies the rules derived from the most comprehensive definition. If the `15` example's final output `12` is strictly required, it implies additional rules not explicitly stated, or the problem has an inherent flaw in its examples. Based on standard competitive programming practices, the most explicit and complete mapping definition is usually the correct one.
