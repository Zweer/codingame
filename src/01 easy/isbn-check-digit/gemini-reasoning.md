The problem asks us to validate a list of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs). There are two types of ISBNs to consider: ISBN-10 and ISBN-13, each with its specific length, character rules, and check digit calculation method.

**ISBN-10 Validation Rules:**
1.  **Length:** Must be 10 characters long.
2.  **Characters:** The first 9 characters must be digits ('0'-'9'). The 10th character (check digit) can be a digit ('0'-'9') or 'X' (representing 10). Any other characters or 'X' in incorrect positions make the ISBN invalid.
3.  **Check Digit Calculation:**
    *   Sum the first 9 digits, each multiplied by a decreasing weight from 10 down to 2 (e.g., `d1*10 + d2*9 + ... + d9*2`).
    *   Calculate the remainder when this sum is divided by 11 (`sum % 11`).
    *   The check digit is `(11 - remainder) % 11`.
    *   If the calculated check digit is 10, it should be represented by 'X'. Otherwise, it's the digit itself.
    *   This calculated check digit must match the 10th character of the given ISBN.

**ISBN-13 Validation Rules:**
1.  **Length:** Must be 13 characters long.
2.  **Characters:** All 13 characters must be digits ('0'-'9'). 'X' is not allowed anywhere in an ISBN-13.
3.  **Check Digit Calculation:**
    *   Sum the first 12 digits, alternating weights of 1 and 3 (e.g., `d1*1 + d2*3 + d3*1 + ... + d12*3`).
    *   Calculate the remainder when this sum is divided by 10 (`sum % 10`).
    *   The check digit is `(10 - remainder) % 10`.
    *   This calculated check digit must match the 13th character of the given ISBN.

**General Invalidity Conditions:**
*   An ISBN with a length other than 10 or 13 is invalid.
*   An ISBN containing non-digit characters (except 'X' at the last position for ISBN-10) is invalid.
*   An 'X' appearing in an ISBN-13, or an 'X' appearing in an ISBN-10 at any position other than the last, makes it invalid.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Read the integer `N`, representing the number of ISBNs to verify.
2.  Initialize an empty array `invalidISBNs` to store ISBNs that fail validation.
3.  Loop `N` times:
    a.  Read an ISBN string from input.
    b.  Call a helper function `validateISBN(isbnString)` to check its validity.
    c.  If `validateISBN` returns `false`, add the `isbnString` to the `invalidISBNs` array.
4.  After processing all `N` ISBNs, print the count of invalid ISBNs followed by ` invalid:`.
5.  Then, print each ISBN from the `invalidISBNs` array on a new line, maintaining their original order.

**`validateISBN` Function Logic:**
*   Check the `length` of the input `isbnString`.
*   If `length === 10`: Apply ISBN-10 rules. Iterate through the first 9 characters, parse them to digits, and ensure they are valid. Calculate the weighted sum. Then, handle the 10th character: if it's 'X', use 10; otherwise, parse it as a digit, ensuring it's valid. Finally, calculate the expected check digit and compare.
*   If `length === 13`: Apply ISBN-13 rules. Iterate through the first 12 characters, parse them to digits, and ensure they are valid (no 'X' allowed). Calculate the alternating weighted sum. Then, parse the 13th character as a digit, ensuring it's valid. Finally, calculate the expected check digit and compare.
*   If `length` is neither 10 nor 13, return `false` immediately.
*   In digit parsing (`parseInt(char, 10)`), `isNaN(digit)` is used to check if the character was successfully converted to a number. If not, it indicates an invalid character.
