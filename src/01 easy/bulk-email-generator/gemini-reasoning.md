The problem asks us to expand a bulk email template by replacing parenthesized choice blocks with one of their clauses. The selection rule is deterministic: for the `i`-th choice encountered, we pick the `i`-th clause (0-indexed, modulo the number of clauses in that block). Choices are guaranteed not to nest.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Input Reading**: The input consists of `N` lines that together form the email template. It's crucial to treat this as a single continuous string for parsing. CodinGame's `readline()` function typically reads a line without its trailing newline. Since the example output preserves newlines between lines that aren't part of a substitution, we should concatenate the input lines, adding a newline character (`\n`) between them (except for the very last line).

2.  **Choice Identification**: The choices are indicated by `(parenthesized text)`, with clauses separated by pipe symbols `|`. A regular expression is the most suitable tool for finding and replacing these patterns in a string. The regex `/\(([^)]*)\)/g` is perfect for this:
    *   `\(` and `\)` match the literal opening and closing parentheses.
    *   `([^)]*)` is a capturing group that matches any character (`.`) that is *not* a closing parenthesis (`[^)]`) zero or more times (`*`). This ensures we capture everything inside the parentheses up to the *next* closing parenthesis, which is correct because choices don't nest.
    *   The `g` flag ensures that `String.prototype.replace()` finds and processes *all* occurrences in the string.

3.  **Replacement Logic**:
    *   We'll use `String.prototype.replace()` with a replacer function. This function gets called for each match found by the regex.
    *   Inside the replacer function, we'll have access to the full matched string (e.g., `(first|second|third)`) and the content inside the parentheses (e.g., `first|second|third`) as a captured group.
    *   We need a counter (`choiceCounter`) to keep track of which choice we are currently processing. This counter should be initialized to 0 and incremented after each replacement.
    *   The captured content (e.g., `"first|second|third"`) is split by the `|` character to get an array of individual clauses.
    *   The index of the clause to select is `choiceCounter % clauses.length`.
    *   The selected clause is returned by the replacer function, which then substitutes the original parenthesized block in the template.

4.  **Output**: After all replacements are done, the resulting string is the expanded email, which is then printed.

**Example Walkthrough**:

Consider the input:
```
3
This is the (first|second|third) choice.
This is the (first|second|third) choice.
This is the (first|second|third) choice.
```

1.  The `fullTemplate` becomes:
    `"This is the (first|second|third) choice.\nThis is the (first|second|third) choice.\nThis is the (first|second|third) choice."`
2.  `choiceCounter` is initialized to `0`.
3.  `replace()` starts:
    *   **First match**: `(first|second|third)`
        *   Captured content: `"first|second|third"`
        *   Clauses: `["first", "second", "third"]`
        *   `selectedIndex = 0 % 3 = 0`
        *   `choiceCounter` becomes `1`.
        *   Returns `"first"`.
    *   **Second match**: `(first|second|third)`
        *   Captured content: `"first|second|third"`
        *   Clauses: `["first", "second", "third"]`
        *   `selectedIndex = 1 % 3 = 1`
        *   `choiceCounter` becomes `2`.
        *   Returns `"second"`.
    *   **Third match**: `(first|second|third)`
        *   Captured content: `"first|second|third"`
        *   Clauses: `["first", "second", "third"]`
        *   `selectedIndex = 2 % 3 = 2`
        *   `choiceCounter` becomes `3`.
        *   Returns `"third"`.
4.  The final `expandedEmail` will be:
    `"This is the first choice.\nThis is the second choice.\nThis is the third choice."`
    This matches the expected output.

**Constraints Check**:
*   `N < 10000` and total template size `< 10000` characters: A single `replace` operation on a string of this size is highly efficient in JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   "Choices don't nest": This simplifies the regex significantly, making `[^)]*` perfectly adequate to match the content of a choice without needing a more complex parsing algorithm.
