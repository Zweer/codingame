The problem asks us to implement a text generator using a Markov chain (specifically, an n-gram model). We are given training text, an n-gram `depth`, the desired output `length` in words, and a `seed` text to start the generation. A specific pseudo-random number generator is also provided for reproducibility.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1.  **Parse Input**: Read the `text`, `depth`, `length`, and `seed` from standard input.

2.  **Initialize Random Seed**: A global `random_seed` variable is needed, initialized to `0`, as per the problem description. The `pick_option_index` function will use and update this variable.

3.  **Build the Markov Chain**:
    *   First, split the `text` into individual words using spaces as delimiters.
    *   Create a `Map` (e.g., `Map<string, string[]>`) to store the Markov chain. The keys will be n-grams (sequences of `depth` words joined by spaces), and the values will be arrays of words that can follow that n-gram in the training text.
    *   Iterate through the `words` array: For each position `i`, extract an n-gram (from `words[i]` to `words[i + depth - 1]`). The word `words[i + depth]` is the `nextWord` that follows this n-gram.
    *   Add `nextWord` to the list associated with the `currentNgramKey` in the `markovChain` map. If the n-gram is encountered again, simply append the new `nextWord` to its existing list of possibilities.

4.  **Generate Text**:
    *   Start with the `seed` text, split into words. This forms the initial part of our `generatedWords` array.
    *   Determine how many more words need to be generated to reach the desired `length`.
    *   Loop to generate new words:
        *   In each iteration, identify the `currentNgram` for lookup. This is always the last `depth` words from the `generatedWords` array. We join these words with spaces to form the `currentNgramKey`.
        *   Look up `currentNgramKey` in the `markovChain` map to get `possibleNextWords`.
        *   If `currentNgramKey` is not found or has no `possibleNextWords` (a "dead end"), stop generating, as we can't continue the chain.
        *   Use the `pick_option_index` function to deterministically select one `nextWord` from `possibleNextWords`.
        *   Append the chosen `nextWord` to `generatedWords`.
    *   The loop continues until the `generatedWords` array reaches or exceeds the target `length`.

5.  **Format Output**:
    *   After generation, the `generatedWords` array might contain more words than `length` (if the `seed` itself was longer than `length`) or fewer (if a dead end was hit).
    *   Use `slice(0, length)` on `generatedWords` to ensure the final output array contains exactly `length` words.
    *   Join the words in the final array with spaces and print the result.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **N-gram Key Formation**: The key for the Markov chain is always `depth` words long. If the initial `seed` has fewer words than `depth`, the problem doesn't explicitly state how to handle it. However, the example seed ("fish is", 2 words) with depth 2 implies that the initial seed length will typically be at least `depth` words long, allowing a valid `depth`-gram to be formed for the first lookup. Our solution assumes this.
*   **Reproducibility**: The `random_seed` variable and `pick_option_index` function must strictly adhere to the provided logic to ensure the correct output for deterministic tests.
*   **Constraints**: The limits on text length, depth, and output length are small enough that this approach will be efficient enough.
