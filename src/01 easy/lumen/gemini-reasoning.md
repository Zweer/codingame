The problem asks us to calculate the number of "dark spots" in an `N x N` room. A dark spot is defined as a cell with 0 "light". Light is emitted by candles placed in the room.

Here's how light spreads and is calculated:
1.  **Base Light:** Every spot initially has 0 "light".
2.  **Candle Light:** A candle at its own position emits `L` light.
3.  **Light Decay:** For every step away from the candle, the light decreases by 1. This "step" is defined by the Chebyshev distance (maximum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates). If a candle is at `(cx, cy)`, a cell at `(x, y)` will receive `L - max(abs(x - cx), abs(y - cy))` light from that specific candle.
4.  **Minimum Light:** Light cannot be negative. If `L - distance` results in a negative value, the light for that spot from that candle is considered 0.
5.  **Multiple Candles:** If a spot is illuminated by multiple candles, it takes the *maximum* light value it can receive from any of them.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize a Light Grid:** Create an `N x N` 2D array (e.g., `lightGrid`) and initialize all its cells to 0. This grid will store the maximum light level for each cell.
2.  **Locate Candles:** Read the input map. As you parse each character, if you find a 'C' (candle), store its `(row, column)` coordinates. A list or array of candle positions would be suitable.
3.  **Calculate Light for Each Cell:**
    *   Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the `N x N` `lightGrid`.
    *   For each cell `(r, c)`, iterate through all the `candlePositions` found in step 2.
    *   For each candle at `(cx, cy)`:
        *   Calculate the Chebyshev distance: `dist = Math.max(Math.abs(r - cx), Math.abs(c - cy))`.
        *   Calculate the potential light from *this candle* at `(r, c)`: `currentCandleLight = L - dist`.
        *   Ensure light is not negative: `actualCandleLight = Math.max(0, currentCandleLight)`.
        *   Update the `lightGrid` cell: `lightGrid[r][c] = Math.max(lightGrid[r][c], actualCandleLight)`. This ensures that `lightGrid[r][c]` always holds the maximum light received from any candle.
4.  **Count Dark Spots:** After processing all candles and updating the `lightGrid`, iterate through the `lightGrid` once more. Count how many cells `(r, c)` have `lightGrid[r][c] === 0`.
5.  **Output:** Print the total count of dark spots.

**Constraints Consideration:**
- `N <= 25`: The grid is small.
- `L < 10`: The light decay is rapid.
The chosen algorithm involves nested loops: `N*N` cells * (number of candles). In the worst case, all `N*N` cells could be candles, leading to `N*N * N*N = N^4` operations. For `N=25`, `25^4 = 390,625`, which is well within typical time limits for competitive programming puzzles.

**Example Walkthrough:**
Given `N=5`, `L=3`, and a candle at `(1,1)` (0-indexed).
- The `lightGrid` starts as all zeros.
- When processing cell `(0,0)`:
    - Candle at `(1,1)`.
    - `dist = Math.max(abs(0-1), abs(0-1)) = Math.max(1,1) = 1`.
    - `currentCandleLight = 3 - 1 = 2`.
    - `actualCandleLight = Math.max(0, 2) = 2`.
    - `lightGrid[0][0] = Math.max(0, 2) = 2`.
- When processing cell `(0,4)`:
    - Candle at `(1,1)`.
    - `dist = Math.max(abs(0-1), abs(4-1)) = Math.max(1,3) = 3`.
    - `currentCandleLight = 3 - 3 = 0`.
    - `actualCandleLight = Math.max(0, 0) = 0`.
    - `lightGrid[0][4] = Math.max(0, 0) = 0`.
This process continues for all cells and all candles. Finally, all cells with a value of 0 in the `lightGrid` are counted. For the given example, the result is 9.
