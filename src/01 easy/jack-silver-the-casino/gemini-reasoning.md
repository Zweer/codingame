The problem asks us to simulate a roulette game played by a target and calculate their final cash amount. We are given the initial cash, the number of rounds, and for each round, the roulette ball result and the target's bet.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Input Reading**:
    *   Read the total `ROUNDS` from the first line.
    *   Read the initial `CASH` from the second line.
    *   For each of the `ROUNDS` lines, parse the `BALL` result and the `CALL` type (and `NUMBER` if `CALL` is "PLAIN").

2.  **Bet Calculation**:
    *   In each round, the target bets `1/4` of their `currentCash`.
    *   Crucially, if this results in a fractional value, it's rounded *up*. This translates to using `Math.ceil(currentCash / 4)`.

3.  **Applying the Bet**:
    *   The calculated `bet` amount is immediately subtracted from `currentCash`. This reflects that the money is put on the table. If the target wins, this `bet` amount is returned as part of the payout.

4.  **Determining Win/Loss and Payout**:
    *   **EVEN**: The target wins if the `BALL` is an even number *and not zero*. If `BALL` is 0, an "EVEN" bet loses. The payout is `1 to 1`.
    *   **ODD**: The target wins if the `BALL` is an odd number. The payout is `1 to 1`.
    *   **PLAIN**: The target wins if the `BALL` exactly matches their specified `NUMBER`. The payout is `35 to 1`.

5.  **Updating Cash**:
    *   **If the target wins**:
        *   Their initial `bet` is returned to them.
        *   Additional winnings are added based on the `payoutMultiplier` (1 for EVEN/ODD, 35 for PLAIN). So, `currentCash += bet + (bet * payoutMultiplier)`.
    *   **If the target loses**:
        *   No further action is needed. The `bet` was already subtracted, representing the loss.

6.  **Edge Case: Zero Cash**:
    *   If `currentCash` becomes 0, the `bet` will be `Math.ceil(0 / 4) = 0`. This means they bet nothing, and their cash remains 0 regardless of the outcome. The problem constraints (`1 <= MONEY <= 1,000,000`) apply to the *final* output, implying that intermediate cash can technically reach 0 or below, though in practice, it will either win back or stay at 0 if it hits it. Our logic naturally handles this by calculating a 0 bet.

7.  **Output**:
    *   After all rounds are processed, print the final `currentCash` amount.

This step-by-step process ensures all rules, including the rounding up of bets and specific win conditions for each bet type, are correctly applied.
