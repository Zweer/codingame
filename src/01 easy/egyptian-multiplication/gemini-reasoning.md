The Egyptian multiplication method, also known as Russian peasant multiplication, relies on the property that any number can be expressed as a sum of powers of two (its binary representation). The multiplication `a * b` is performed by repeatedly doubling one number (`a`) and halving the other (`b`). If `b` is odd, the current doubled `a` value is added to a running sum.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the implementation:

1.  **Input Reading and Sorting**:
    *   The two input integers `a` and `b` are read from a single line, separated by a space.
    *   According to the puzzle description, the numbers should be sorted. We designate `num1` as the larger number (which will be repeatedly doubled) and `num2` as the smaller number (which will be repeatedly halved).

2.  **Initial Output**:
    *   The first line of output is the initial multiplication expression: `num1 * num2`.

3.  **Initialization**:
    *   `currentMultiplicand`: Starts as `num1`, will be doubled in each step.
    *   `currentMultiplier`: Starts as `num2`, will be halved (integer division) in each step.
    *   `termsToAdd`: An array to store the `currentMultiplicand` values that need to be summed up at the end. A term is added to this array if `currentMultiplier` is odd in the current step.
    *   `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine`: A crucial variable to correctly format the last intermediate line (the one with `* 0`). This variable stores the `currentMultiplicand` just before `currentMultiplier` becomes `1` (which means `currentMultiplier` will become `0` in the *next* step after halving). This allows us to print `X * 0` where `X` is the value of the multiplicand from the *previous* meaningful step, matching the example.

4.  **Main Loop (`while (currentMultiplier > 0)`)**:
    *   The loop continues as long as `currentMultiplier` is greater than zero.
    *   **Check for Odd Multiplier**: Inside the loop, `currentMultiplier % 2 !== 0` checks if the `currentMultiplier` is odd. If it is, the `currentMultiplicand` at this point is added to the `termsToAdd` array.
    *   **Capture `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine`**: If `currentMultiplier` is `1`, it means this is the last iteration where `currentMultiplier` is non-zero. The `currentMultiplicand` value at this moment is stored in `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine`. This is the value that will be used for the `* 0` part of the final intermediate line.
    *   **Update for Next Iteration**:
        *   `currentMultiplicand` is doubled (`currentMultiplicand * 2`).
        *   `currentMultiplier` is halved (`Math.floor(currentMultiplier / 2)`).
    *   **Print Intermediate Line**:
        *   A string `lineString` is constructed.
        *   If `currentMultiplier` is still greater than 0 (meaning it's not the very last intermediate step), the line format is `= new_multiplicand * new_multiplier`. Note that `new_multiplicand` and `new_multiplier` refer to the values *after* being updated for the next iteration.
        *   If `currentMultiplier` has become `0` (meaning this is the intermediate step leading to the final sum), the line format is `= prevMultiplicandForZeroLine * 0`, using the stored multiplicand.
        *   Finally, if `termsToAdd` is not empty, all accumulated terms are appended to `lineString` using ` + ` as a separator.
        *   This `lineString` is then printed.

5.  **Final Sum**:
    *   After the loop terminates (when `currentMultiplier` is `0`), all relevant `currentMultiplicand` values that correspond to odd multipliers are accumulated in `termsToAdd`.
    *   The `finalSum` is calculated by summing all elements in `termsToAdd`.
    *   The final sum is printed in the format `= sum`.

**Example Trace (12 * 5):**

1.  `num1 = 12`, `num2 = 5`.
2.  Print: `12 * 5`
3.  Initial: `currentMultiplicand = 12`, `currentMultiplier = 5`, `termsToAdd = []`, `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine = 0`.

**Loop 1 (currentMultiplier = 5):**
    *   `5` is odd: `termsToAdd.push(12)` -> `[12]`
    *   `5` is not `1`: `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine` remains `0`.
    *   Update: `currentMultiplicand = 24`, `currentMultiplier = 2`.
    *   Print line: `currentMultiplier (2)` is `> 0`. Line: `= 24 * 2`. `termsToAdd` has `[12]`. Output: `= 24 * 2 + 12`.

**Loop 2 (currentMultiplier = 2):**
    *   `2` is even: `termsToAdd` remains `[12]`.
    *   `2` is not `1`: `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine` remains `0`.
    *   Update: `currentMultiplicand = 48`, `currentMultiplier = 1`.
    *   Print line: `currentMultiplier (1)` is `> 0`. Line: `= 48 * 1`. `termsToAdd` has `[12]`. Output: `= 48 * 1 + 12`.

**Loop 3 (currentMultiplier = 1):**
    *   `1` is odd: `termsToAdd.push(48)` -> `[12, 48]`.
    *   `1` IS `1`: `prevMultiplicandForZeroLine = 48`.
    *   Update: `currentMultiplicand = 96`, `currentMultiplier = 0`.
    *   Print line: `currentMultiplier (0)` is `0`. Line: `= ${prevMultiplicandForZeroLine} * 0` -> `= 48 * 0`. `termsToAdd` has `[12, 48]`. Output: `= 48 * 0 + 12 + 48`.

**Loop terminates** (currentMultiplier is now 0).

**Final Sum:**
    *   `finalSum = 12 + 48 = 60`.
    *   Print: `= 60`.

This matches the example output precisely.
