The problem asks us to simulate rotations of a 1x1x1 Rubik's cube and determine the final orientation of two specific faces. A 1x1x1 cube is effectively a point with six distinct faces (Front, Back, Up, Down, Left, Right) always pointing in opposite directions along three axes.

**1. Representing the Cube's State:**
We can represent the initial orientation of the cube's faces using a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system:
- **F** (Front): `(0, 0, 1)` (Positive Z-axis)
- **B** (Back): `(0, 0, -1)` (Negative Z-axis)
- **U** (Up): `(0, 1, 0)` (Positive Y-axis)
- **D** (Down): `(0, -1, 0)` (Negative Y-axis)
- **R** (Right): `(1, 0, 0)` (Positive X-axis)
- **L** (Left): `(-1, 0, 0)` (Negative X-axis)

We will maintain the current direction vector for each queried face. Initially, these vectors correspond to their stated directions.

**2. Understanding Rotations:**
The rotations `x, y, z` are clockwise quarter turns, and `x', y', z'` are counter-clockwise quarter turns. The problem states that `x, x'` rotate on the `R` face, `y, y'` on `U`, and `z, z'` on `F`. This means rotations are around the X, Y, and Z axes respectively.

When we rotate the *cube* (a rigid body), it's equivalent to rotating the coordinate system itself. If we want to find where an *original* face (e.g., the initial "Down" face) ends up pointing *in the fixed world coordinate system*, we need to apply the *inverse* of the cube's rotation to the direction vector of that original face.

For example, if we rotate the cube `z` (clockwise around F, i.e., positive Z-axis):
- The original `D` (Down) face, pointing initially to `(0, -1, 0)`, will now point to where the `L` (Left) face originally was, i.e., `(-1, 0, 0)`.
- The original `L` (Left) face, pointing initially to `(-1, 0, 0)`, will now point to where the `U` (Up) face originally was, i.e., `(0, 1, 0)`.

This transformation from `(0, -1, 0)` to `(-1, 0, 0)` is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation around the Z-axis.
Similarly, `(-1, 0, 0)` to `(0, 1, 0)` is also a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation around Z.

Therefore, for a clockwise cube rotation (e.g., `z`), we apply a counter-clockwise rotation matrix to the face's direction vector.
For a counter-clockwise cube rotation (e.g., `z'`), we apply a clockwise rotation matrix to the face's direction vector.

**3. Rotation Matrices (for Vectors):**
A 90-degree clockwise rotation matrix around an axis (`R_axis(90)`) transforms points/vectors. The inverse of `R_axis(90)` is `R_axis(-90)`.
- **Clockwise (positive 90 deg) rotations:**
  - `R_x(90)`: `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1], [0, 1, 0]]`
  - `R_y(90)`: `[[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0]]`
  - `R_z(90)`: `[[0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`

- **Counter-clockwise (negative 90 deg) rotations:**
  - `R_x(-90)`: `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, -1, 0]]`
  - `R_y(-90)`: `[[0, 0, -1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`
  - `R_z(-90)`: `[[0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`

Based on our analysis, for a cube rotation `M`, we apply `M_inverse` to the face vectors.
- `x` (cube clockwise on R): apply `R_x(-90)` to vectors.
- `x'` (cube counter-clockwise on R): apply `R_x(90)` to vectors.
- `y` (cube clockwise on U): apply `R_y(-90)` to vectors.
- `y'` (cube counter-clockwise on U): apply `R_y(90)` to vectors.
- `z` (cube clockwise on F): apply `R_z(-90)` to vectors.
- `z'` (cube counter-clockwise on F): apply `R_z(90)` to vectors.

**4. Algorithm:**
1.  **Initialize:** Create a map to store the initial 3D vector for each face name (`F`, `B`, `U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
2.  **Matrices:** Create a map to store the appropriate 3x3 transformation matrix for each rotation command (`x`, `x'`, `y`, `y'`, `z`, `z'`).
3.  **Read Input:** Get the string of rotations and the two queried face names.
4.  **Current State:** Initialize the current direction vectors for the two queried faces using their initial mappings.
5.  **Apply Rotations:**
    *   Split the input rotation string into individual commands.
    *   For each command, retrieve its corresponding transformation matrix.
    *   Multiply each of the current face vectors by this matrix to get their new directions. Update the current face vectors.
6.  **Determine Final Faces:** After all rotations are applied, convert the final 3D vectors back to their corresponding face names using a reverse mapping (or a series of `if/else if` checks).
7.  **Output:** Print the two final face names.

**Example 1 walkthrough (`z`, `D`, `L`):**
Initial `D`: `(0, -1, 0)`
Initial `L`: `(-1, 0, 0)`
Rotation `z` means apply `R_z(-90)` matrix: `[[0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`

- For `D` (`(0, -1, 0)`):
  `[0 * 0 + (-1) * 1 + 0 * 0]`  -> `-1`
  `[0 * (-1) + (-1) * 0 + 0 * 0]` -> `0`
  `[0 * 0 + (-1) * 0 + 0 * 1]`   -> `0`
  New vector for `D`: `(-1, 0, 0)`, which is `L`.

- For `L` (`(-1, 0, 0)`):
  `[-1 * 0 + 0 * 1 + 0 * 0]`  -> `0`
  `[-1 * (-1) + 0 * 0 + 0 * 0]` -> `1`
  `[-1 * 0 + 0 * 0 + 0 * 1]`   -> `0`
  New vector for `L`: `(0, 1, 0)`, which is `U`.

The results `L` and `U` match the example output, confirming the approach.
