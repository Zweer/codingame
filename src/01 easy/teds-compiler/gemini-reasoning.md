The problem asks us to find the length of the longest prefix of a given string that constitutes a "valid" expression. A valid expression, in this context, consists of `<` and `>` characters, adhering to specific rules:
1. Every `<` must have a matching `>` character *after* it.
2. Every `>` symbol must *exactly match* a `<` symbol (meaning it cannot be an unmatched closing symbol).
3. Nested expressions are valid (e.g., `<<>>`).

This problem can be efficiently solved using a balance counter, similar to how balanced parentheses are checked.

**Reasoning:**

We can iterate through the input string character by character, maintaining a `currentBalance` variable.
- When an opening character `<` is encountered, we increment `currentBalance`.
- When a closing character `>` is encountered, we decrement `currentBalance`.

For a prefix to be valid, two conditions must be met:
1. The `currentBalance` must never drop below zero at any point. If it does, it means we encountered a `>` without a corresponding preceding `<`. This makes the current prefix invalid, and any longer prefix starting from the beginning of the string will also be invalid. In this scenario, we can stop processing further characters, as `maxValidLength` would have already captured the longest valid prefix (or remain 0 if none was found).
2. For a complete valid expression, the `currentBalance` must be exactly zero at the end of the prefix. This ensures that every opening `<` has a matching closing `>`.

We also need a `maxValidLength` variable to keep track of the length of the longest valid prefix found so far. It should be initialized to 0.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize `maxValidLength = 0`.
2. Initialize `currentBalance = 0`.
3. Iterate through the input string `line` from index `i = 0` to `line.length - 1`:
   a. If `line[i]` is `'<'`, increment `currentBalance`.
   b. If `line[i]` is `'>'`, decrement `currentBalance`.
   c. **Check for invalid state:** If `currentBalance` becomes less than `0` at any point, it means the current prefix `line[0...i]` is invalid (due to an unmatched `>`). Since we are looking for a prefix of the *original* string, any longer prefix (`line[0...j]` where `j > i`) will also be invalid because it includes this problematic unmatched `>`. Therefore, we can immediately stop iterating and return the current `maxValidLength`.
   d. **Check for valid prefix:** If `currentBalance` becomes exactly `0`, it means the prefix `line[0...i]` is a valid, balanced expression. We update `maxValidLength` with `Math.max(maxValidLength, i + 1)` (because `i + 1` is the length of the prefix).
   e. If `currentBalance` is greater than `0`, it means we currently have unmatched `<` characters, so the prefix is not yet a complete valid expression, but it is still a potentially valid start, so we continue.

4. After the loop finishes (either by iterating through the entire string or by `break`ing early), `maxValidLength` will hold the length of the longest valid prefix. Print this value.

**Example: `<<>>>`**

- `line = "<<>>>"`, `maxValidLength = 0`, `currentBalance = 0`

- `i = 0`, `char = '<'`: `currentBalance` becomes `1`.
- `i = 1`, `char = '<'`: `currentBalance` becomes `2`.
- `i = 2`, `char = '>'`: `currentBalance` becomes `1`.
- `i = 3`, `char = '>'`: `currentBalance` becomes `0`.
  `currentBalance` is `0`, so `maxValidLength = Math.max(0, 3 + 1) = 4`.
- `i = 4`, `char = '>'`: `currentBalance` becomes `-1`.
  `currentBalance` is less than `0`. The loop `break`s.

- Final `maxValidLength` is `4`.

This approach ensures that we only consider prefixes that never had an unmatched `>` and correctly captures the longest one that ends with a balanced state.
