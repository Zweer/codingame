The puzzle asks us to determine the order of succession to the British throne based on a given list of people and their family details. The core of the problem involves building a family tree, sorting children based on specific rules, and then traversing the tree in a depth-first manner while applying exclusion criteria.

Here's a breakdown of the solution steps:

1.  **Data Structure for a Person**:
    We define an `interface Person` to store all relevant attributes: `name`, `parentName` (used for initial tree construction), `birthYear`, `deathYear` (null if alive), `religion`, `gender`, and a `children` array to link to their direct descendants in the tree structure.

2.  **Input Parsing and Initial Tree Construction**:
    *   Read the number of people `n`.
    *   Iterate `n` times to read each person's details.
    *   Store each person in a `Map<string, Person>` where the key is their name. This allows efficient lookup of parents.
    *   Identify the `rootPerson` (the monarch) by checking whose `parentName` is `"-"`.
    *   After all people are parsed and stored in the map, iterate through the map again. For each person, find their parent using `parentName` and add the current person to the parent's `children` array. This effectively builds the family tree structure.

3.  **Sorting Children**:
    The crucial part of the succession order is how siblings are ordered. The rules are:
    *   **Gender**: Male descendants come before female descendants.
    *   **Age**: Within the same gender, older people (lower birth year) come before younger people.
    To implement this, we create a recursive function `sortAllChildren`. This function takes a `Person` object, sorts its `children` array using a custom comparator, and then recursively calls itself for each of those children. This ensures that the children arrays throughout the entire tree are sorted according to the succession rules.

4.  **Succession Traversal**:
    The problem describes a depth-first, pre-order like traversal: "begin on the left of the tree, walk to the next level whenever possible otherwise continue to the right." This means we process the current person, then their first child (recursively), then their second child (recursively), and so on.
    We implement this with a recursive function `getSuccessionOrder`.
    *   Before adding a person to the final list, we apply the **exclusion rules**:
        *   Exclude dead people (`deathYear` is not `null`).
        *   Exclude Catholic people (`religion` is `Catholic`).
        *   Note: Siblings of excluded people are still considered, so we don't prune branches. We only filter at the output stage.
    *   After processing the current person, the function recursively calls itself for each of their children, ensuring they are processed in the order determined by the `sortAllChildren` step.

5.  **Output**:
    Finally, iterate through the `successionList` (which now contains names in the correct order) and print each name on a new line.

**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**

Input:
```
6
Elizabeth - 1926 - Anglican F
Charles Elizabeth 1948 - Anglican M
William Charles 1982 - Anglican M
George William 2013 - Anglican M
Charlotte William 2015 - Anglican F
Henry Charles 1984 - Anglican M
```

1.  **Tree Construction**:
    *   Elizabeth is the root.
    *   Elizabeth's children: `[Charles]`
    *   Charles's children: `[William, Henry]`
    *   William's children: `[George, Charlotte]`

2.  **Sorting Children**:
    *   `Charles`'s children `[William (M, 1982), Henry (M, 1984)]` remain `[William, Henry]` (both male, sorted by age).
    *   `William`'s children `[George (M, 2013), Charlotte (F, 2015)]` are sorted to `[George, Charlotte]` (male before female).

3.  **Traversal**:
    *   `Elizabeth` (alive, Anglican) -> Added.
        *   `Charles` (alive, Anglican) -> Added.
            *   `William` (alive, Anglican) -> Added.
                *   `George` (alive, Anglican) -> Added.
                *   `Charlotte` (alive, Anglican) -> Added.
            *   `Henry` (alive, Anglican) -> Added.

Output:
```
Elizabeth
Charles
William
George
Charlotte
Henry
```
This matches the example output, demonstrating the correct application of the rules.
