The problem asks us to identify a single killer among `N` suspects. The core rule is that all innocent people (villagers) tell the truth, while only the killer lies. We are given `N` statements, each from a suspect, describing where they were and who they were with (or if they were alone). If, after considering all possibilities, no suspect can be the killer, then the detective (you) is the killer.

**Key Rules and Their Implications:**

1.  **Only the killer lies; villagers tell the truth.** This is the foundation. If we assume a person is a villager, their statement *must* be true. If we assume a person is the killer, their statement *must* be false.
2.  **The killer can claim to have been anywhere, with anyone.** This means the specific content of the killer's lie doesn't directly tell us their *true* alibi. It only tells us their *reported* alibi is false.
3.  **Villagers (non-killers) haven't seen the killer.** If a villager `V` truthfully states they were with `K` (the assumed killer), then `K` cannot be the killer. This is a direct contradiction.
4.  **Villagers (non-killers) were not in the same location as the killer.** This is slightly more subtle. Since the killer's *actual* location is unknown, and they lie about their reported location, we cannot directly use `V.reportedLocation === K.reportedLocation` as a contradiction. However, the puzzle constraints ("no ambiguous cases") suggest that simpler direct contradictions are sufficient.
5.  **If the killer claims to be alone, the claim can be proven to be false.** This is a very strong rule. If our assumed killer claims to be alone, this immediately invalidates them as the killer. It implies that a killer cannot truthfully make such a claim, or rather, if they make it, it's a lie that leads to an impossible scenario (they were with someone, but no villager would report being with them, and there's only one killer).

**Algorithm:**

Given that `N` is small (2 to 10), we can iterate through each suspect and assume they are the killer. For each assumption, we check if all statements (especially those of the presumed innocent villagers) are consistent with our rules.

1.  **Parse Input:**
    *   Read `N`.
    *   For each of the `N` lines, parse the statement into a structured object containing the `name`, `location`, and a `Set<string>` of `companions` (or the string `'alone'` if they were alone).
    *   Store these parsed statements in a `Map` for quick lookup by name, and keep a list of all names.

2.  **Iterate through each `killerCandidate`:**
    *   For each `killerCandidate` from the `allNames` list, *assume* they are the killer.
    *   Set a flag `isKillerCandidateValid = true`.

3.  **Check `killerCandidate`'s statement:**
    *   **Rule `K_LIE_ALONE`**: If the `killerCandidate`'s statement says they were `alone`, then `isKillerCandidateValid` becomes `false`. This `killerCandidate` cannot be the killer. Move to the next `killerCandidate`.

4.  **Check all other people (villagers):**
    *   For every `personName` that is *not* the `killerCandidate` (i.e., they are presumed villagers):
        *   Their statement *must* be true.
        *   **Rule `V_NO_K_COMPANION`**: If `villagerStatement.companions` is not `'alone'` AND `villagerStatement.companions` contains `killerCandidate`, then this `villager` claimed to be with the `killerCandidate`. This violates the rule that villagers haven't seen the killer. Set `isKillerCandidateValid = false` and `break` from this inner loop (this `killerCandidate` is invalid).
        *   **Rule `V_MUTUAL_ALIBI`**: Check for consistency among villagers' statements:
            *   If `villagerStatement.companions` is `'alone'`: Ensure no *other* villager claims to have been with this `villager`. If another villager `X` claims `villager` as a companion, it's a contradiction. Set `isKillerCandidateValid = false` and `break`.
            *   If `villagerStatement.companions` lists other names (e.g., `C1, C2`): For each `companionName` in their list that is also a `villager` (not the `killerCandidate`):
                *   Their `location` claims must match: `villagerStatement.location === companionStatement.location`. If not, `isKillerCandidateValid = false` and `break`.
                *   Their `companions` claims must be reciprocal: `companionStatement.companions` must not be `'alone'` AND must contain `personName`. If not, `isKillerCandidateValid = false` and `break`.

5.  **Determine Result:**
    *   If, after all checks, `isKillerCandidateValid` remains `true` for a `killerCandidate`, then that `killerCandidate` is the killer. Print their name followed by " did it!" and terminate. (Since there's only one solution, we can stop at the first valid one).
    *   If the loop finishes and no `killerCandidate` was found to be valid, it means everyone has a consistent alibi that prevents them from being the killer. In this specific puzzle scenario, this implies the detective (you) are the killer. Print "It was me!".

This approach directly applies the given rules as logical checks, leading to a unique solution in all provided examples and covering the special "It was me!" case.
