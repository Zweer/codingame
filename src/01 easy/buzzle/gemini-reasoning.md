The puzzle requires implementing the "Buzzle" game up to Level 4. Level 4 combines all previous rules and adds the complexity of operating in an arbitrary base `n` for digit-related rules.

Here's a breakdown of the rules and how they are implemented:

**Input:**
*   `n`: The base for digit-related rules (2 <= n <= 64).
*   `a`, `b`: The start and end numbers of the range (inclusive, 1 <= a < b <= 10000).
*   `k`: The count of special numbers (1 <= k < n).
*   `num`: An array of `k` special integers (2 <= numbers in num < n).

**Output:**
For each number from `a` to `b`, print "Buzzle" if it satisfies any of the conditions for any special number, otherwise print the number itself.

**Buzzle Rules (for a number `value` and any `specialNum` from `num`):**

1.  **Multiple of `specialNum`:** `value` is a multiple of `specialNum` (checked in base 10, i.e., `value % specialNum === 0`). This rule does not change with the base `n`.

2.  **Ends with `specialNum` (in base `n`):** The last digit of `value` when represented in base `n` is `specialNum`. This is equivalent to checking `value % n === specialNum`.

3.  **Sum of digits is a Buzzle (in base `n`):**
    *   First, calculate the sum of the digits of `value` when `value` is represented in base `n`. Let this sum be `S`.
    *   Then, find the "digital root" of `S` in base `n`. This means repeatedly summing the digits of `S` (each time converting the sum to base `n` for its digits) until a single-digit number (less than `n`) is obtained. Let this digital root be `DR`.
    *   Finally, check if this `DR` itself satisfies the "multiple of `specialNum`" rule (i.e., `DR % specialNum === 0`) or the "ends with `specialNum`" rule (i.e., `DR === specialNum`, since `DR` is a single digit).

The solution implements a function `isBuzzle(value, n, specialNums)` that encapsulates these rules. It iterates through each `specialNum` and checks the three rules. If any rule is met for any `specialNum`, the function returns `true`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  Read `n`, `a`, `b` from the first line of input.
2.  Read `k` from the second line.
3.  Read the `k` `specialNums` from the third line.
4.  Loop from `i = a` to `b`:
    a.  Call `isBuzzle(i, n, specialNums)`.
    b.  If it returns `true`, print "Buzzle".
    c.  Otherwise, print `i`.

**Example Walkthrough for Rule 3 (Digital Root):**
Consider the example from the problem: `value = 95`, `n = 12`, `specialNum = 7`.
*   Convert 95 to base 12: `95 / 12 = 7` remainder `11`. So 95 is `7B` in base 12 (where `B` represents 11).
*   Sum of digits in base 12: `7 + 11 = 18` (in base 10).
*   Now, find the digital root of `18` in base `12`:
    *   `18` is greater than `n=12`.
    *   Convert `18` to base 12: `18 / 12 = 1` remainder `6`. So `18` is `16` in base 12.
    *   Sum its digits: `1 + 6 = 7`.
    *   `7` is less than `n=12`, so `7` is the digital root.
*   Check if `DR=7` satisfies Rule 1 or Rule 2 for `specialNum=7`:
    *   `7 % 7 === 0` (Rule 1). Yes.
    *   Therefore, 95 is a Buzzle.
