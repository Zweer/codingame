The problem requires us to process information about tributes in the Hunger Games, specifically who killed whom, and then display this information for each tribute in a structured, alphabetically sorted manner.

Here's a breakdown of the solution strategy:

1.  **Data Structure:** We need to store information for each tribute. A `Map<string, TributeInfo>` is ideal, where the key is the tribute's name (for quick lookup) and `TributeInfo` is an object containing:
    *   `name`: The tribute's name.
    *   `killed`: A `Set<string>` to store the names of tributes they killed. Using a `Set` automatically handles duplicate additions and allows for easy conversion to a sorted array later.
    *   `killer`: A `string | null` to store the name of the tribute who killed them, or `null` if they are still alive. This will eventually become "Winner" for the surviving tribute.

2.  **Input Processing - Initial Tributes:**
    *   Read the total number of tributes, `N`.
    *   Loop `N` times, reading each tribute's name.
    *   For each name, create a new `TributeInfo` object with an empty `killed` set and `killer` as `null`, and add it to our `tributes` map.

3.  **Input Processing - Kill Events:**
    *   Read the number of turns, `T`.
    *   Loop `T` times, reading each kill event line.
    *   Parse each line: "KillerName killed VictimName1, VictimName2, ..."
        *   Split the string by " killed " to separate the killer's name from the victims' names.
        *   Split the victims' names string by ", " to get an array of individual victim names.
    *   For each killer and their victims:
        *   Retrieve the `TributeInfo` for the killer from the map.
        *   For each `victimName` in the list, add `victimName` to the `killed` set of the `killerTribute`.
        *   Retrieve the `TributeInfo` for the `victimName` from the map.
        *   Set the `killer` property of the `victimTribute` to `killerName`.

4.  **Determine the Winner:**
    *   After processing all kill events, iterate through all `TributeInfo` objects in the `tributes` map.
    *   The tribute whose `killer` property is still `null` is the winner. Set their `killer` to "Winner". The problem statement guarantees only one winner.

5.  **Output Generation:**
    *   Get all tribute names (keys from the `tributes` map) and sort them alphabetically.
    *   Iterate through these sorted names:
        *   Retrieve the `TributeInfo` for the current name.
        *   Print "Name: [Tribute Name]".
        *   For the "Killed" information:
            *   Convert the `killed` `Set` to an array and sort it alphabetically.
            *   If the array is empty, print "Killed: None".
            *   Otherwise, join the sorted names with ", " and print "Killed: [Sorted Victims]".
        *   Print "Killer: [Killer Name or Winner]".
        *   After each tribute's information block, print a blank line, except for the very last tribute.

This approach ensures all data is correctly linked, allows for efficient updates, and handles all output formatting requirements, including alphabetical sorting and special "None"/"Winner" cases.
