## Reasoning

The problem requires converting a given time with its UTC offset into Swatch Internet Time, expressed in "beats". This involves several steps:

1.  **Parse the Input:** The input format is `HH:MM:SS UTC[+/-]hh:mm`. We need to extract the hours, minutes, and seconds of the given time, as well as the sign, hours, and minutes of its UTC offset.
2.  **Convert to UTC:** The first critical step is to determine the equivalent time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The input time is `HH:MM:SS` in a specific timezone `UTC[+/-]hh:mm`.
    *   First, calculate the total seconds from midnight for the given `HH:MM:SS`.
    *   Then, calculate the timezone offset in seconds. If the sign is `+`, the offset is positive; if `-`, it's negative.
    *   To get UTC time, we subtract the timezone offset from the local time. (e.g., if local time is UTC+4, it means it's 4 hours *ahead* of UTC, so UTC = local - 4 hours).
3.  **Convert to Biel Time (UTC+01:00):** Swatch Internet Time is based on Biel Mean Time (BMT), which is UTC+01:00. Once we have the time in UTC seconds, we add 1 hour (3600 seconds) to get the time in Biel seconds.
4.  **Normalize Biel Time:** The time might cross midnight (become negative or exceed 24 hours) after the conversions. We need to normalize it to be within a single 24-hour cycle (0 to 86399 seconds). A common way to do this for potentially negative numbers is `(value % total_seconds_in_day + total_seconds_in_day) % total_seconds_in_day`.
5.  **Calculate Beats:** The formula for beats is `(total_biel_seconds) / 86.4`. This is because a day has 86400 seconds, and 1000 beats also represent a day, so 1 beat = 86.4 seconds.
6.  **Round and Format:** The final result must be rounded to two decimal places using "half-up" rounding and always presented with two decimal digits (e.g., `@12.34` or `@12.00`).
    *   JavaScript's `Math.round()` does not guarantee half-up rounding (it often uses half-even or banker's rounding).
    *   A reliable method for half-up rounding to `N` decimal places for positive numbers is `Math.floor(number * (10^N) + 0.5) / (10^N)`. For two decimal places, this becomes `Math.floor(beats * 100 + 0.5) / 100`.
    *   `toFixed(2)` is then used to ensure the output always has two decimal places, even if the value is an integer or has only one decimal place (e.g., `100` becomes `"100.00"`).

The solution directly implements these steps.
