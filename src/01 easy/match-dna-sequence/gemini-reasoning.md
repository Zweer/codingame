The puzzle asks us to find a given `gene` sequence within several `chr` (chromosome) sequences. The matching does not need to be perfect; up to `delta` differences (swapped characters) are allowed. We need to find the first such match, reporting the `chr`'s index, the starting position of the `gene` within that `chr`, and the exact number of differences for that match. If no match is found within the `delta` limit, we should output "NONE".

**Problem Analysis and Strategy:**

1.  **Input Parsing:** We need to read `delta`, the `gene` string, the number `n` of `chr` sequences, and then `n` `chr` strings.

2.  **Matching Logic:**
    *   We will iterate through each `chr` sequence provided. Let's call the current `chr`'s index `i`.
    *   For each `chr`, we will then iterate through all possible starting positions (`j`) where the `gene` could begin. The `gene` has a fixed length of 42, and `chr` has a fixed length of 128. This means the `gene` can start anywhere from index 0 up to `chr.length - gene.length` (which is `128 - 42 = 86`). If the `gene` starts at index 86, it occupies characters `chr[86]` through `chr[127]`, which is exactly 42 characters and fits perfectly within the `chr`.
    *   For each potential starting position `j`, we compare the `gene` character by character with the substring of `chr` of the same length.
    *   We maintain a `currentDifferences` count. If `gene[k]` is not equal to `chr[j + k]`, we increment `currentDifferences`.
    *   **Optimization:** If `currentDifferences` ever exceeds `delta` during the character-by-character comparison, we can immediately stop comparing for the current `j` (starting position) because it's already an invalid match. We then move to the next `j`.
    *   **"Missing Characters" Rule:** The problem statement mentions "If the last characters of genes are out of the bounds of chr (chr is too short), it counts as a delta corresponding to the missing characters." Given the fixed lengths (`gene` = 42, `chr` = 128), a `gene` will *always* fit entirely within a `chr` if started at or before index 86. Thus, this rule about missing characters will never apply, simplifying the problem to a standard Hamming distance calculation.

3.  **Outputting the First Match:**
    *   The problem asks for the "first match" in terms of `chr` index and then `start` index within the `chr`.
    *   Our nested loop structure (outer loop for `chr` index `i`, inner loop for `start` index `j`) naturally processes potential matches in the required order.
    *   As soon as we find *any* match where `currentDifferences <= delta`, we immediately print the result (`i j currentDifferences`) and terminate the program. This ensures we output the very first valid match found.

4.  **No Match Scenario:** If all `chr` sequences and all possible starting positions are checked without finding any valid match, we print "NONE".

**Complexity:**
*   `N` (number of `chr`s): up to 20
*   `L_chr` (length of `chr`): 128
*   `L_gene` (length of `gene`): 42
*   The outer loop runs `N` times.
*   The middle loop runs `L_chr - L_gene + 1` times (`128 - 42 + 1 = 87` times).
*   The innermost loop (character comparison) runs `L_gene` times (42 times) in the worst case (when `delta` is large or all characters match).
*   Total operations: `N * (L_chr - L_gene + 1) * L_gene` = `20 * 87 * 42` = `73,080` character comparisons in the absolute worst case, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.
