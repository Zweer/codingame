The problem asks us to find the minimum Manhattan distance between any two horse strengths. Each horse's strength is represented as a 2D vector `(Velocity, Elegance)`. The Manhattan distance between two points `(V1, E1)` and `(V2, E2)` is given by `abs(V2 - V1) + abs(E2 - E1)`.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Input Reading:** We first need to read the number of horses, `N`. Then, we loop `N` times, reading the `Velocity` and `Elegance` for each horse. It's convenient to store these as objects or structured types in an array.

2.  **Distance Calculation:** The core of the problem is calculating the Manhattan distance. The `Math.abs()` function in TypeScript (and JavaScript) is suitable for this.

3.  **Finding the Minimum:** To find the minimum distance between *any* two horses, we must compare all possible unique pairs of horses.
    *   We can use nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first horse (`i = 0`) up to the second-to-last horse (`i = N - 2`).
    *   The inner loop iterates from the horse *after* the current outer loop's horse (`j = i + 1`) up to the last horse (`j = N - 1`). This ensures we only consider unique pairs and don't compare a horse with itself.
    *   We initialize a `minDistance` variable to a very large number (e.g., `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`).
    *   Inside the inner loop, for each pair `(horses[i], horses[j])`, we calculate their Manhattan distance.
    *   We then update `minDistance` if the newly calculated distance is smaller.

4.  **Constraints Analysis:**
    *   `N` is between 10 and 600.
    *   `V` and `E` are between 0 and 10,000,000.
    *   The number of pairs to check is `N * (N - 1) / 2`. For `N = 600`, this is `600 * 599 / 2 = 179,700` pairs.
    *   Calculating the Manhattan distance is a constant-time operation.
    *   An `O(N^2)` approach (iterating through all pairs) will be perfectly efficient enough for `N=600`, as 179,700 operations is very fast on modern CPUs (typically millions or hundreds of millions of operations per second). More complex `O(N log N)` algorithms for closest pair are not necessary here and would add undue complexity.

5.  **Output:** Finally, print the `minDistance` found.

**Code Structure for CodinGame:**

CodinGame provides `readline()` to read a line from standard input and `print()` to write to standard output. These functions are implicitly available in the execution environment.
