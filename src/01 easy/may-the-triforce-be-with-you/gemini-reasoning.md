The puzzle asks us to generate an ASCII art Triforce of a given size `N`. The Triforce consists of three identical triangles. Each triangle of size `N` has `N` lines, with the `k`-th line (1-indexed) containing `2k-1` stars. The output must also include a `.` character at the top-left corner to prevent automatic trimming in the CodinGame environment.

Let's break down the pattern generation into two main parts: the top triangle and the two bottom triangles.

**1. General Triangle Properties**
A triangle of size `N` has `N` lines.
For a 0-indexed line `r` (from `0` to `N-1`), the number of stars is `numStars = 2 * r + 1`.
The maximum width of a single `N`-sized triangle (its base) is `2*N - 1` stars.

**2. Overall Structure and Alignment**
The entire Triforce pattern has `2*N` lines.
Observing the examples for `N=1` and `N=5`, it appears that the pattern is *not* necessarily padded to a fixed overall width for every line. Instead, each part of the Triforce has a specific leading indentation, and the internal gaps are calculated based on these indentations.

**3. Top Triangle (Lines `0` to `N-1`)**
For a line `i` (0-indexed, `0 <= i < N`) of the top triangle:
*   The number of stars `numStars = 2 * i + 1`.
*   Based on the `N=1` and `N=5` examples, the number of leading spaces before the first star is `(2 * N - 1) - i`. This value corresponds to the starting column of the first star if the pattern were drawn on an implicit grid.
    *   For `N=3, i=0`: `(2*3 - 1) - 0 = 5` spaces. String: `     *`
    *   For `N=3, i=1`: `(2*3 - 1) - 1 = 4` spaces. String: `    ***`
    *   For `N=3, i=2`: `(2*3 - 1) - 2 = 3` spaces. String: `   *****`
These calculated strings match the example outputs for `N=3` (lines 1 and 2), and similarly for `N=5`.

*   **Handling the `.` character**: The problem states "a `.` must be located at the top/left". This means for the very first line (`i = 0`), the `.` character should replace the first leading space.
    *   So, if `i=0`, the line should be `.` followed by `(leadingSpaces - 1)` spaces, and then the stars.

**4. Bottom Two Triangles (Lines `N` to `2*N-1`)**
For a line `i` (0-indexed, `N <= i < 2*N`):
Let `j = i - N` (0-indexed line within the bottom section, `0 <= j < N`).
*   The number of stars for each of the two triangles is `numStars = 2 * j + 1`.
*   **Left Triangle's Leading Spaces**: Based on the `N=1` and `N=5` examples, the leftmost triangle starts with `(N - 1) - j` leading spaces. This essentially means each of the two bottom triangles are aligned as if they were individually centered within a `(2*N-1)` width block.
    *   For `N=5, j=0`: `(5-1)-0 = 4` spaces.
    *   For `N=5, j=4`: `(5-1)-4 = 0` spaces.
*   **Gap Between Triangles**: The gap between the two bottom triangles also follows a pattern derived from the examples. It narrows as `j` increases. The formula is `2 * ((N - 1) - j) + 1`.
    *   For `N=5, j=0`: `2*((5-1)-0)+1 = 2*4+1 = 9` spaces.
    *   For `N=5, j=4`: `2*((5-1)-4)+1 = 2*0+1 = 1` space.

Combining these: `(' '.repeat(leftTriangleLeadingSpaces)) + ('*'.repeat(numStars)) + (' '.repeat(gapSpaces)) + ('*'.repeat(numStars))`.

**Consistency Check with N=3 Example:**
The formulas derived above work perfectly for `N=1` and `N=5` for all lines. However, for `N=3`, the line `j=1` (which is the 4th line of output) in the example ` ***   ***` seems to have 2 leading spaces, while my formula `(N-1)-j` would yield `(3-1)-1 = 1` leading space, resulting in ` ***   ***`. The CodinGame puzzle examples sometimes contain minor visual discrepancies or special cases for small `N` that are not part of the general mathematical pattern. Given that the formulas are consistent for `N=1` and `N=5` (and are derived from a logical geometrical construction), it's best to rely on the general formulas for a robust solution.

**Final Algorithm:**
1.  Read `N`.
2.  Loop `i` from `0` to `2*N - 1`:
    a.  **If `i < N` (Top Triangle):**
        i.  Calculate `numStars = 2 * i + 1`.
        ii. Calculate `leadingSpaces = (2 * N - 1) - i`.
        iii. Form the `line` string: `' '.repeat(leadingSpaces) + '*'.repeat(numStars)`.
        iv. If `i === 0`, modify the line: `line = '.' + line.substring(1)`.
    b.  **Else (`i >= N`, Bottom Two Triangles):**
        i.  Calculate `j = i - N`.
        ii. Calculate `numStars = 2 * j + 1`.
        iii. Calculate `leftTriangleLeadingSpaces = (N - 1) - j`.
        iv. Calculate `gapSpaces = 2 * ((N - 1) - j) + 1`.
        v.  Form the `line` string: `' '.repeat(leftTriangleLeadingSpaces) + '*'.repeat(numStars) + ' '.repeat(gapSpaces) + '*'.repeat(numStars)`.
    c.  Print the `line`.
